// TestRebuild_PrefixlessTestsAreCounted is the integration test for #2608:
// after the testmap pathHints fix (#2604), the grafel_test_coverage MCP
// tool STILL reports 107 test entities on upvate instead of the expected
// ~1,406+.
//
// Root cause (#2608):
//
//	#2604 fixed the testmap extractor's selectFramework so that files in
//	tests/ directories without a test_ prefix (e.g. core/tests/schedule.py)
//	are now recognised as pytest test files and produce SCOPE.Pattern entities.
//	HOWEVER, the TotalTests counter in ComputeCoverage (internal/graph/coverage.go)
//	does NOT count SCOPE.Pattern entities — it counts SCOPE.Operation / Function /
//	Method entities inside test files (issue #1410 rationale).
//
//	The entity-kind classifier isTestFile (coverage.go:isTestFile) already
//	handles /tests/ directory paths correctly via its path-segment check
//	(checks for "/tests/" segment in the slashed path). But no integration
//	test exercised the path-segment check against actual indexer output —
//	unit tests only covered the isTestFile function directly, not the
//	end-to-end flow from Python extractor → graph.Document → ComputeCoverage.
//
// This test closes the gap by running the full indexer on a Django fixture
// with test files that have NO test_ prefix (core/tests/schedule.py,
// api/tests/views.py) and asserting that ComputeCoverage.TotalTests is
// non-zero — i.e. SCOPE.Operation entities from those files are counted
// as test entities.
//
// Companion tests:
//
//	internal/graph/coverage_test.go:TestIsTestFile (unit: isTestFile covers /tests/ paths)
//	cmd/grafel/rebuild_2604_test.go:TestRebuild_AllPassesProduceExpectedEdges
//	  (asserts SCOPE.Pattern entities produced; TotalTests NOT asserted there)

// TestRebuild_PrefixlessTestsAreCounted asserts that Django-style test files
// in tests/ directories (without a test_ prefix in their basename) are counted
// in ComputeCoverage.TotalTests after a full indexer run.
//
// The fixture at testdata/django_tests_fixture includes:
//
//	core/tests/schedule.py  — 2 test methods (test_list, test_import_csv)
//	api/tests/views.py      — 1 test method (test_schedule_list)
//
// All three methods are emitted as SCOPE.Operation entities by the Python
// extractor. isTestFile("core/tests/schedule.py") must return true (via the
// path-segment check on "/tests/") so ComputeCoverage counts them in TotalTests.
//
// If TotalTests is 0 after indexing these files, the path-segment check is not
// reaching the entity classification path — indicative of the #2608 bug where
// TotalTests stays at 107 (only test_*.py files counted) regardless of how
// many tests/ directory files exist.
