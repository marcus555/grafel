/* ============================================================
   components/flow-dag/layout.ts — pure-tree unfold + dagre layout for <FlowDag>.

   The daemon ships a deduped DAG (each node id once; a convergence node carries
   >1 in-edge). The renderer UNFOLDS that DAG into a pure TREE (#4479): starting
   at `root_id` we walk the edges and DUPLICATE any node reached via more than
   one path, so every rendered instance has exactly ONE incoming edge and may
   have many outgoing. The result lays out cleanly under dagre with no fan-in /
   crossing edges.

   Each instance is keyed by its path ("<parentInstanceId>/<nodeId>") and carries
   the ORIGINAL node's data (name/kind/role/file/… ) for the detail panel and the
   caller's selection contract. Safety: the unfold honors the depth control and a
   hard max-node cap, and tracks the path's visited set so a diamond — or a stray
   cycle, which shouldn't occur in a DAG — can never infinitely expand or hang the
   browser. When a cap fires we stop expanding and surface honest truncation.

   The H/V toggle maps directly onto dagre's `rankdir`: "LR" (horizontal,
   left→right) or "TB" (vertical, top→bottom).
