/* ============================================================
   components/flow-dag/layout.ts — pure-tree unfold + tidy-tree layout for <FlowDag>.

   The daemon ships a deduped DAG (each node id once; a convergence node carries
   >1 in-edge). The renderer UNFOLDS that DAG into a pure TREE (#4479): starting
   at `root_id` we walk the edges and DUPLICATE any node reached via more than
   one path, so every rendered instance has exactly ONE incoming edge and may
   have many outgoing. The result lays out cleanly as a tidy tree with no
   fan-in / crossing edges.

   Each instance is keyed by its path ("<parentInstanceId>/<nodeId>") and carries
   the ORIGINAL node's data (name/kind/role/file/… ) for the detail panel and the
   caller's selection contract. Safety: the unfold honors the depth control and a
   hard max-node cap, and tracks the path's visited set so a diamond — or a stray
   cycle, which shouldn't occur in a DAG — can never infinitely expand or hang the
   browser. When a cap fires we stop expanding and surface honest truncation.

   The H/V toggle chooses which screen axis is the tree's MAIN (depth) axis:
   "LR" (horizontal, depth→x, left→right) or "TB" (vertical, depth→y,
   top→bottom). The cross axis is packed by a subtree-contiguous tidy layout
   (#4622) so each branch reads as one cluster.

/* ============================================================
   Tidy-tree positioning (#4622).

   dagre's per-rank ordering minimizes edge crossings but does NOT keep a
   subtree's nodes in a contiguous cross-axis band: a deep child of branch A
   can be placed inside the cross-axis span of sibling branch B, so the branch
   reads as belonging to the wrong cluster. We replace dagre's coordinate
   assignment with a classic Reingold–Tilford-style tidy tree where, by
   construction, every subtree occupies a CONTIGUOUS cross-axis band and
   sibling subtrees are separated by a clear gap. The result: clicking a node
   highlights a branch that is one visually-contiguous cluster.

   Main axis  = tree depth (rank). depth d → main = MARGIN + d * (NODE_main + RANK_GAP).
   Cross axis = packed leaf order. Leaves are placed left→right at a fixed
                cross-step; each internal node is centered over its children.
                A larger gap is inserted BETWEEN sibling subtrees than between
                adjacent leaves of the same parent, so branches separate.
