/* ============================================================
   components/flow-dag/layout.ts — pure-tree unfold + tidy-tree layout for <FlowDag>.

   The daemon ships a deduped DAG (each node id once; a convergence node carries
   >1 in-edge). The renderer UNFOLDS that DAG into a pure TREE (#4479): starting
   at `root_id` we walk the edges and DUPLICATE any node reached via more than
   one path, so every rendered instance has exactly ONE incoming edge and may
   have many outgoing. The result lays out cleanly as a tidy tree with no
   fan-in / crossing edges.

   Each instance is keyed by its path ("<parentInstanceId>/<nodeId>") and carries
   the ORIGINAL node's data (name/kind/role/file/… ) for the detail panel and the
   caller's selection contract. Safety: the unfold honors the depth control and a
   hard max-node cap, and tracks the path's visited set so a diamond — or a stray
   cycle, which shouldn't occur in a DAG — can never infinitely expand or hang the
   browser. When a cap fires we stop expanding and surface honest truncation.

   The H/V toggle chooses which screen axis is the tree's MAIN (depth) axis:
   "LR" (horizontal, depth→x, left→right) or "TB" (vertical, depth→y,
   top→bottom). The cross axis is packed by a subtree-contiguous tidy layout
   (#4622) so each branch reads as one cluster.

   highlights a branch that is one visually-contiguous cluster.

   Main axis  = tree depth (rank). depth d → main = MARGIN + d * (NODE_main + RANK_GAP).
   Cross axis = packed leaf order. Leaves are placed left→right at a fixed
                cross-step; each internal node is centered over its children.
                A larger gap is inserted BETWEEN sibling subtrees than between

/* ============================================================
   ELK backend (default) — shared elkjs layered layout via lib/elk-layout.ts.

   Part of the elkjs adoption epic (#4824/#4827). The unfolded pure tree is a
   layered DAG, so we run ELK's `layered` algorithm with orthogonal edge routing
   for clean right-angle connectors. Direction follows the H/V toggle: "LR" →
   RIGHT (depth left→right), "TB" → DOWN (depth top→bottom). The tree has no
   compound containment (every instance is a root-level node), so we pass a flat
   node list and a `lane` = tree depth to keep the layered ranks pinned to tree
   depth (so the layout reads strictly outward from the endpoint, matching the
   tidy-tree's main-axis semantics).

   The DATA on each node/edge is built by the same `buildFlowDagNode` /
   `buildFlowDagEdges` helpers the tidy-tree backend uses, so the displayed
   graph is identical across engines — only the positions differ.

   `shape` is a forward hook for the flowchart view (#4819): a future flowchart
   mode can pass different node dimensions/spacing without touching this call.
