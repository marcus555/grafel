   chrome/screens.ts — the per-project screen registry.

   Single source of truth for the screens that live inside a
   project (group). Consumed by the LEFT SIDEBAR (nav-rail) — the
   PRIMARY screen nav — and by the project switcher to preserve
   the current screen across a project switch (#1572).

   The left sidebar lists these screens for the current project;
   the top-right control is the PROJECT switcher.
