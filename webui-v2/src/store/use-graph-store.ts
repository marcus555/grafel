// tuning; on load, if the stored version is missing or < the current one, DISCARD
// the stale stored tuning and adopt the new code defaults. Bump this whenever a
// default in DEFAULT_SIMULATION / DEFAULT_NODE_SIZING / DEFAULT_RENDER changes so
// the change actually lands on next load with no manual Reset.
// Fix #1580: bump so the lowered base-size floor + auto-scale defaults reach
// users who already have a stored sizing blob (e.g. baseSize 90 from v2).
// Fix #1581: bump again — the recurring "reload restores a contracted layout"
// bug is rooted in stale CACHED LAYOUTS produced by retired force defaults. We
// scope the layout cache by graph-layout-cache.LAYOUT_VERSION (kept in lock-step
// with this constant); bumping here also discards stale persisted TUNING so the
// current force defaults (which produce the good spread) actually apply on load.
// Fix #1607: bump to 5 — the sizing model changed shape entirely (baseSize is now
// a unitless multiplier, pointSizeScale is 1.0, scalePointsOnZoom is off, defaults
// retuned). A stored v4 sizing/render blob (baseSize 90, pointSizeScale 0.22,
// scalePointsOnZoom true) would be catastrophically wrong under the new model, so
// discard it and adopt the new code defaults on next load — no manual Reset.
// Fix #4492: bump to 6 in LOCK-STEP with graph-layout-cache.LAYOUT_VERSION. #4470
// changed the initial-position SEEDING (low-degree leaf anchoring), altering the
// settled geometry for the same node set; the layout cache is scoped by
// LAYOUT_VERSION (kept equal to this constant), so a v5→v6 bump invalidates every
// pre-anchoring cached layout. Without it, a returning user's stale v5 layout was
// pinned static on first load (sim never ran) and only Reset re-settled — the
// "graph needs a manual Reset to lay out" bug. No DEFAULT_SIMULATION/sizing value
// changed here, so persisted tuning is unaffected; this bump exists purely to keep
// the two version stamps in lock-step per the documented protocol.
// Fix #4852: bump to 7 (in lock-step with graph-layout-cache.LAYOUT_VERSION) so the
// retuned DEFAULT_RENDER.linkOpacity (0.6 → 0.55) reaches users who already have a
