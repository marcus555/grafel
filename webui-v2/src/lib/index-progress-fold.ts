/* ============================================================
   index-progress-fold.ts — pure row-folding for the live indexing feed (#1527,
   dedup fix #5326).

   The daemon SSE stream (/api/index-progress/:group) emits a firehose of
   progress.Event records. For a single repo it emits BOTH a repo-level event
   (module="") AND, while extracting, a module-scoped event (module="<repo>").
   Keying rows by repo+module produced TWO rows per repo — a live repo-level row
   plus a stale "<repo> module" duplicate that froze mid-extraction (#5326 bug 2).

   The fix: there is exactly ONE row per repo, keyed by repo_slug alone. Module-
   scoped events fold into that same repo row, and the latest event wins so the
   row always reflects the most recent phase/file/entity counts. We retain the
   richest module label seen (for the optional "module" badge) but never split.

   This logic is extracted from use-index-progress.ts so it is unit-testable
   under `vitest run src/lib` without a DOM.
