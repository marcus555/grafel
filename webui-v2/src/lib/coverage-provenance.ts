/**
 * coverage-provenance — pure provenance/branch logic for the dashboard
 * coverage-provenance banner (#5038).
 *
 * archigraph surfaces THREE distinct things all colloquially called
 * "coverage", and a bare "%" reads as authoritative when it may be any of
 * them, stale, or absent. This module turns the raw availability state for a
 * given view into a single, unambiguous provenance descriptor that the
 * {@link CoverageProvenanceBanner} renders. It is intentionally DOM-free and
 * side-effect-free so the branch selection is unit-testable under the default
 * (node) vitest environment — the component is a thin renderer over the
 * descriptor this returns.
 *
 * The three concepts (kept verbatim in {@link COVERAGE_DEFINITIONS} for the
 * self-documenting tooltip):
 *
 *   1. CAPABILITY coverage (registry.json) — what archigraph's EXTRACTOR
 *      supports per language/framework. NOT test execution.
 *   2. LINE coverage (dynamic, #5036) — real %, present ONLY if an
 *      LCOV/Cobertura/JaCoCo report was ingested. Stamps entity props
 *      `coverage_pct` / `covered_lines` / `total_lines` / `coverage_source` /
 *      `coverage_measured_at`.
 *   3. REACHABILITY (static, #5037) — graph-derived `test_reachable` /
 *      reaching tests, no execution.
 *
 * Degradation rule (v1): live wiring of ingested line-coverage into the
 * dashboard data layer is still pending (#5036 landed the parser/attribution,
 * not the dashboard hook), so most callers will only have reachability or
 * nothing. We pick the BEST available source and NEVER present a misleading
 * authoritative "%". When nothing is wired, we fall back to the
 * capability-coverage explanation as the safe default.
