   lib/graph-layout-cache.ts — persist / restore settled graph positions.

   LESSON PORTED FROM v1: caching the settled Float32 positions in
   localStorage lets a return visit skip the explode/settle animation
   entirely and render the laid-out graph INSTANTLY.

   Key:   grafel.v2.layout.<layoutVersion>.<group>.<nodesetHash>
   Value: base64-encoded Float32Array of [x0, y0, x1, y1, ...]

   The node-set hash (FNV-1a over sorted node IDs) keys the cache so a graph
   whose nodes changed (re-index) misses and re-lays-out. A 2 MB guard avoids
   blowing the localStorage quota on huge graphs.

   Fix #1581: the cache key is ALSO scoped by a LAYOUT_VERSION. The settled
   positions are a product of the simulation / force defaults; when we ship new
   force defaults (#1566/#1569/#1586/…) the OLD cached positions are stale — a
   reload restored a layout produced by forces that no longer exist (the
   over-contracted blob), while Reset re-ran the sim with the new forces and
   produced the good spread. Bumping LAYOUT_VERSION whenever the layout-producing
   defaults change makes every key under the old version a guaranteed MISS, so a
   ship of new forces always re-settles. (Keep this in lock-step with the store's
   DEFAULTS_VERSION — bump both when DEFAULT_SIMULATION changes.)

/**
 * Fix #1581: version stamp baked into every layout-cache key. Bump this whenever
 * a change can alter the SETTLED GEOMETRY for the same node set — i.e. any change
 * to the simulation / force defaults (DEFAULT_SIMULATION), the cluster-seeding, or
 * the settle routine. Old-version entries become unreachable keys (a miss), so the
 * graph re-settles with the current forces on next load instead of restoring a
 * layout baked by retired forces. Tracks the store's DEFAULTS_VERSION (=4 at the
 * time of #1581).
 *
 * Fix #2107: bump to 5 — DEFAULTS_VERSION was already bumped to 5 in use-graph-store
 * (#1607 sizing model overhaul) but LAYOUT_VERSION was left at 4. The mismatch meant
 * the store discarded stale tuning but the layout cache STILL LOADED old positions
 * (cached under the v4 key) produced by the retired forces. Since those positions
 * were spread enough to pass isDegenerateLayout they were accepted and the graph
 * rendered collapsed on every reload. Keeping this in lock-step with DEFAULTS_VERSION
 * guarantees all v4 caches are a guaranteed miss; first load re-settles with current
 * forces (== Reset). Reload === Reset by construction.
 *
 * Fix #4492: bump to 6 — #4470 (low-degree leaf ANCHORING — seeding any rendered-
 * degree-≤1 node on top of its single neighbor instead of in its group-center blob)
 * changed the INITIAL-POSITION SEEDING and therefore the SETTLED GEOMETRY for the
 * same node set, but neither version stamp was bumped. So a returning user's v5
 * cached layout (baked WITHOUT the anchoring) still passed isLayoutHealthy and was
 * PINNED STATIC on load (the doSettle cache path) — the force sim never ran, so the
 * graph showed the old un-anchored layout and only "exploded" into the new spread
 * after a manual Reset (which routes through kickFreshSettle). Bumping makes every
 * v5 layout a guaranteed miss → first load runs the unified fresh settle. Reload ===
 * Reset by construction. (Kept in lock-step with DEFAULTS_VERSION = 6.)
 *
 * Fix #4852: bump to 7 — kept in lock-step with DEFAULTS_VERSION = 7, which was
 * bumped to ship the retuned DEFAULT_RENDER.linkOpacity. No layout-producing force
 * changed (this is a pure render/opacity tweak), so the only effect of this bump is
 * a harmless one-time re-settle on next load; the lock-step is maintained purely to
 * honor the documented protocol (the two stamps must move together).
