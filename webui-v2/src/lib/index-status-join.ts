/* ============================================================
   index-status-join.ts — join the status-plane poll (GET
   /api/v2/groups/{group}/index-status) onto the SSE progress rows (#47 phase 2).

   The SSE stream drives per-repo phase/file progress, but it stops once the
   graph is queryable — it has no visibility into the `enhancing` (background
   relationship enrichment) state or engine CPU/RSS. The status-plane poll fills
   that gap. Both surfaces key each repo by the SAME `repo_slug`, so these pure
   helpers merge the two by slug: the web wizard uses them to drive a secondary
   "enhancing" bar, CPU/RAM badges, and to know when to keep polling — mirroring
   the TUI (see internal/cli/wiztui/indexview.go bgProgressBlock + metricSuffix).

   Extracted as pure functions so they are unit-testable under `vitest run
   src/lib` without a DOM or a live daemon.
