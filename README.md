**grafel** is a local code-knowledge-graph daemon that gives AI agents structural navigation across one or many repos — call graphs, cross-repo traces, HTTP surface maps, process flows — via 65 MCP tools.

**A companion to `grep`, not a replacement:** `grep` finds text, grafel maps structure. Its value is **navigation** — where `X` is defined, who calls `Y`, how a request flows end-to-end, the blast radius of a change — the questions grep can't answer. (Fewer file reads also means fewer tokens — a side effect, not the point.)

---

## grep finds text. grafel finds the answer.

Three questions an AI agent actually gets asked — and where plain `grep` leaves it stranded (fictional projects; grafel works the same on yours):

**1. "Where does `amountDue` on the invoice report come from — end to end?"**
- **grep** matches `amountDue` in a React component, a controller, maybe a SQL string — but can't connect them or say which column backs it. The agent guesses.
- **grafel** traces the whole lineage: `InvoiceReport.tsx` (web-app) → `GET /reports/invoices` (api-gateway) → `requirePermission('billing:read')` → `BillingController.getInvoiceReport` (billing-service) → `InvoiceRepository.computeAmountDue()` → `SELECT … FROM invoice_lines JOIN invoices` → the **`invoices.amount_due` column in Postgres**. Component → endpoint → permission → service → ORM → query → table.

**2. "I'm renaming `Invoice.amountDue` → `Invoice.balance`. What breaks?"**
- **grep** drowns in false positives, and can't see that `web-app` and `mobile-app` read the field off the JSON response — it crosses the wire, not an import.
- **grafel** warns it breaks `billing-service` (model + 3 call sites + the `invoices.amount_due` mapping) **and** `web-app`'s `InvoiceCard` **and** `mobile-app`'s `InvoiceScreen` — it tracks the HTTP payload shape across repos. A "backend rename" is really a frontend + mobile change.

**3. "We're renaming the `invoice-events` topic / moving the `reports` database — what's affected?"**
- **grep** finds the name scattered across Terraform, Helm, and code — but can't tell you which services publish or consume it.
- **grafel** links infra to code: the Kafka topic `invoice-events` is **published by** `billing-service`, **consumed by** `notifications-service` and `analytics-service`; the Terraform `aws_db_instance.reports` connection string flows (via a Kubernetes ConfigMap) into `billing-service` and `analytics-service`. The real blast radius across infra ↔ services ↔ code.

## Why grafel

AI coding agents are good at reading files. They are not good at navigating relationships between files — especially across multiple repositories. Ask an agent "what calls `PaymentService.charge`?" and it will grep, guess, and sometimes hallucinate. Ask it to trace a request from the mobile app through the API gateway to the database — across three repos — and it will read dozens of files it doesn't need.

grafel pre-builds the relationship map. It indexes your codebase into an in-memory graph (entities, call edges, import edges, HTTP routes, message-bus topics) and keeps it fresh via file watchers. When an agent asks a structural question, it gets a precise answer in one round-trip instead of twenty file reads.

The graph lives entirely on your machine — local-first by design, as called out above. One binary, one daemon process, one port.

---

## What you get

- **Call graph navigation** — find every caller of a function, walk dependency chains, trace paths between any two entities. Works across repos in a single query.
- **HTTP surface mapping** — enumerate every route definition and every call-site that references it; surface orphan callers (client calls with no matching server handler) without manually auditing both sides.
- **Process flow tracing** — pre-computed BFS from entry points (route handlers, `main`, framework hooks) stored as traceable chains; ad-hoc follow from any entity on demand.
- **Message-bus topology** — topic/broker/service groupings for event-driven systems; publisher and subscriber orphan detection.
- **Cross-repo dependency graph** — index a folder of repos as one group; edges span repo boundaries with confidence scores; diff graph state between any two indexed refs.
- **Documentation and analysis skills** — a 15-skill family (tech docs, business docs, security audit, consultant panel, patterns) all driven off the graph, invokable from Claude Code as slash commands.
- **Real-time dashboard** — 19 surfaces (Graph, Flows, Event-flows, Topology, Paths, Links, GraphQL, IaC, Docs, Security, Taint, DI, Error-flow, Quality, Settings, Pending, Operations, Compare, Missing) embedded in the daemon, no separate server, at `http://127.0.0.1:47274`.

## Quickstart

Install with one line. On macOS / Linux:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cajasmota/grafel/main/install.sh | bash
```

On Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cajasmota/grafel/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

On Windows without PowerShell (CMD):

```bat
curl -fL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cajasmota/grafel/main/install.bat -o "%TEMP%\grafel-install.bat" && "%TEMP%\grafel-install.bat"
```

All Windows paths are non-admin. For a locked-down/manual install see [docs/install-windows-manual.md](docs/install-windows-manual.md).

Then point it at your code and wire it up:

```sh
# 1. Point it at your code (interactive)
grafel wizard

# 2. Start the daemon + register MCP + install skills
grafel install

# 3. Confirm everything is wired
grafel status

# 4. Open the dashboard
grafel dashboard
```

Prefer to build from source? See [docs/install.md](docs/install.md) for the full install matrix (source build, manual binary download, dev mode).

To verify from inside Claude Code:
```
grafel_whoami()
grafel_stats()
grafel_clusters()
```

## Dashboard

grafel ships a local web dashboard: an in-browser view of your code knowledge graph. It is served by the daemon at `http://127.0.0.1:47274/` and opened with `grafel dashboard` (which auto-starts the daemon if it isn't already running). Everything runs on your machine — the dashboard reads the same in-memory graph the MCP server does, with no cloud, no upload, and no account. Same local-first posture as the rest of grafel: your code never leaves your laptop.

### Key views

The left rail switches between per-project screens:

- **Graph** — the hero surface: a GPU-accelerated, force-directed visualization of the whole knowledge graph (cosmos.gl), with search, community/cluster grouping, module analysis, color modes, and filters. A live MCP-activity overlay glows the nodes your agent touches in real time, with a replayable query log.
- **Topology** — async message-channel map for event-driven systems: topics, brokers, services, and publisher/subscriber relationships.
- **Paths** — API & endpoint explorer: every HTTP route and its definition, callers, downstream flow, parameters, response shapes, and auth posture. The downstream-flow modal can flip from a call tree to a per-function **control-flow flowchart** (React Flow + elkjs layout) for the endpoint's handler.
- **Flows** — process-flow explorer: layered DAGs per flow, multi-service traces, saga forward/compensation paths, plus dead-end and truncated-flow views.
- **Links** — cross-repo links between entities that span repository boundaries.
- **GraphQL** / **Infrastructure (IaC)** — GraphQL schema surface and infrastructure-as-code resource diagrams.
- **Docs** — generated documentation (from the `/grafel-tech-docs` and `/grafel-business-docs` skills) rendered in-app.
- **Security** / **Taint** / **DI** / **Error flow** — security findings, taint paths, dependency-injection wiring, and error/exception flow.
- **Quality** — graph-health surface: orphan audit and recall measurement.
- **Operations** — daemon control, logs, learned-patterns store, and update checks.
- **Pending** — residual-edge and repair suggestions awaiting review.
- **Settings** — per-group management (repos, watchers/git-hooks, docs path, health check) and the **AI coding tools** panel: a checklist to pick which tools grafel installs its MCP entry and rules files into. Changes apply instantly, daemon-up, across every repo in the group.

---

## How it works

grafel runs as a background daemon. The daemon manages a tree-sitter-based indexer (50+ languages), an in-memory graph loaded from `.grafel/graph.fb` per repo, an MCP server on stdio, live file watchers, and the embedded dashboard — all as one process.

```
your repos
    |
    v  grafel index (tree-sitter + resolver)
 .grafel/graph.fb   <-- per-repo binary graph snapshot
    |
    v  daemon (in-memory, mtime-driven reload)
 MCP server (stdio) -- AI agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, ...)
 Dashboard (HTTP)   -- browser at http://127.0.0.1:47274
```

When an agent calls `grafel_find(query="payment processing")`, the daemon runs BM25 against entity labels and qualified names, then expands outward via BFS — returning a ranked, token-budgeted subgraph in one call. No files are read at query time.

After `grafel install`, the daemon registers itself as an MCP server in your Claude Code config automatically. No manual JSON editing.

---

## When you'd reach for it

**Onboarding to an unfamiliar codebase** — run `grafel wizard`, index, then ask your agent to orient you with `grafel_clusters` and `grafel_traces`. You get a module map and top-level flows in minutes instead of hours.

**Doing a code review and want to know the blast radius** — `grafel_expand` from the changed entity shows every caller and downstream dependency. The `/grafel-aware-review` skill surfaces this automatically during review.

**Generating documentation** — `/grafel-tech-docs` produces per-module READMEs, API reference, cross-cutting concerns, and a group synthesis. `/grafel-business-docs` produces PM-facing capability descriptions and user journeys from the same graph.

**Auditing security** — `/grafel-security-audit` runs deterministic static checks (auth coverage, reachability, orphan endpoints, PII exposure paths) then an LLM confirmation pass.

**Working across a monorepo or multi-repo group** — grafel cross-links repos in a group and resolves edges across repo boundaries, so `grafel_trace(source="mobile-app::UICheckout", target="payments-api::ChargeHandler")` works even though those entities live in different repositories.

## Languages

Core extractors for 50+ languages including Go, Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, Java, C#, C++, Rust, Ruby, PHP, Swift, Kotlin, Scala, Dart, Elixir, and more. Infrastructure: Terraform/HCL, Solidity, Verilog/SystemVerilog. Frontend: Vue SFC, Svelte, Astro. Cross-cutting: SQL, GraphQL, Protocol Buffers, Dockerfile.

Each extractor emits language-specific edges (HTTP endpoints, ORM queries, dynamic dispatch, framework hooks).

### Coverage

grafel tracks **39 languages (25 active), 255 frameworks, 176 ORMs, 129 tools, and 205 other** capabilities, plus cross-cutting infrastructure: databases, platform/k8s, message brokers, CI/CD, security, observability, protocols, and build systems.

Top languages by framework support:

| Language | Frameworks | ORMs | Tools |
|----------|-----------:|-----:|------:|
| JS/TS | 33 | 19 | 21 |
| C/C++ | 25 | 10 | 16 |
| python | 25 | 18 | 15 |
| java | 23 | 15 | 10 |
| go | 21 | 17 | 8 |
| C# | 18 | 16 | 7 |
| kotlin | 18 | 7 | 0 |
| rust | 17 | 15 | 10 |

See the [full coverage matrix](docs/coverage/summary.md) for every language and the complete cross-cutting infrastructure tables. Per-language detail lives in [docs/coverage/by-language/](docs/coverage/by-language/); per-category detail in [docs/coverage/by-category/](docs/coverage/by-category/).

## Status

**v0.x — early release.** APIs, MCP tool names, and graph schema may still change between minor versions. macOS is the primary supported platform; Linux is tested; Windows is supported.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for breaking changes.

## Contributing

**grafel gets better the more real-world code it sees.** The single most useful thing you can do is point it at your *actual* codebase — and if an extractor misses an entity, mislabels a framework, or leaves edges unresolved, tell us **without sharing a single line of code**.

### Report a quality issue — anonymized and offline

Found a gap? Report it **without sharing a line of code** — two ways:

- **In Claude Code:** invoke the **`/grafel-feedback`** skill (or just ask your agent to "file a grafel feedback report"). It runs the report, walks you through verifying it, and helps you open the issue.
- **In a terminal:** run the CLI directly:
  ```sh
  grafel feedback --group <your-group>
  ```

Either way the report is generated by grafel's Go CLI — **the anonymization happens in code, not in an LLM**: every identifier becomes an ephemeral per-report hash (`ent_a3f7`), file paths collapse to depth-only templates (`<ts>/<seg>/<seg>.ts`), counts are bucketed, and only public framework-annotation names (`@GetMapping`, `@Inject`) survive. **No source code, no real paths, no real names, no network calls, no telemetry, no auto-submit** — you get a `.md` file you review end-to-end, then paste into the [feedback issue template](https://github.com/cajasmota/grafel/issues/new?template=feedback-report.yml).

So point grafel at your real corpus, and if an extractor misses something, file a feedback report — it's safe on proprietary code, and it's the single most useful contribution you can make.
