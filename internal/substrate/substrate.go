// Package substrate implements the Phase 0 static-analysis substrate (#2716).
//
// The substrate is a per-language data layer that lifts constant bindings out
// of source files into a normalised IR so the generic propagation pass in
// internal/links/constant_propagation.go can resolve identifiers across
// files via the IMPORTS edge graph.
//
// Design notes:
//   - Per-language sniffers are pure functions that take a file's source
//     content and return a slice of Binding records. They do not touch the
//     graph or the disk; they are stateless.
//   - The propagation pass owns scope (file, line, ident) → Binding
//     resolution, the IMPORTS-edge walk (max depth 3), and the property
//     stamping. Sniffers are oblivious to that infrastructure.
//   - There is intentionally no ConstantBinding entity kind. Bindings
//     are decoration on existing declaration entities; the persistent
//     graph surface is a property + a RESOLVES_TO edge (see kinds.go).
//
// Adding a new language: implement a sniffer with the SniffFn signature,
// register it via Register("<lang>", sniffFn) in an init() in the
// language file, and add capability cells per AGENTS.md.
