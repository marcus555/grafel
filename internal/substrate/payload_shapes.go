// Payload-shape substrate (#2770 Phase 2A).
//
// For every HTTP endpoint we want to know the field shapes of the
// request and the response on both sides of the wire — the producer
// (server-side handler) and the consumer (client call-site). The
// generic drift detector at internal/links/payload_drift.go cross-
// references the two and emits SchemaDrift findings when fields
// observed on one side are missing on the other.
//
// Per the substrate split (mirrors Phase 0 / 1A / 1B):
//
//   - Per-language sniffers are pure functions over file content.
//     Stateless, deterministic, nil-safe. They emit PayloadShape
//     records pinned to a declaring function name (the handler or
//     the caller).
//   - The generic drift pass owns the cross-repo join. It walks the
//     cross-repo HTTP links produced by http_pass.go, resolves
//     producer / consumer handlers and callers to entities, and
//     pulls the payload shapes registered against each side.
//
// Storage model: no new persistent entity kind. Shapes live in a
// sidecar JSON document keyed by (repo, file, function, direction),
// and the drift findings live in their own sidecar
// <group>-links-payload-drift.json read by the new MCP tool
// grafel_payload_drift.
//
// Adding a new language: implement a PayloadShapeSniffFn, register it
// via RegisterPayloadShapeSniffer("<lang>", fn) in init() in the
// per-language file (payload_shapes_<lang>.go). Both directions
// (request/response) and both sides (producer/consumer) are emitted
// from the same sniffer when the language has both client and server
// idioms — most modern languages do.
