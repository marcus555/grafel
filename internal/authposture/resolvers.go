// resolvers.go — the PLUGGABLE auth-posture resolver registry (epic #4419
// all-framework mandate). Each Resolver maps ONE framework's native auth signal
// into the shared {Kind, Literal} vocabulary defined in authposture.go.
//
// A Resolver receives a Signal — the framework-neutral bundle of evidence the
// MCP tool harvested from a graph entity (its auth-posture properties plus, when
// available, the raw source body of the relevant method). The resolver inspects
// whichever fields its framework stamps and returns a Posture (or ok=false when
// the signal is not its framework).
//
// Sequencing per the epic: FLAGSHIP resolvers (Django DRF + NestJS) are
// implemented in full here; every other framework is registered as a STUB that
// reports ok=false so the registry shape is fixed and the follow-up tickets
// (Spring/Rails/FastAPI/Laravel/ASP.NET/Go/Phoenix — ref #4419) drop in without
// touching the diff core. Flagship-first sequencing is allowed; flagship-ONLY is
// not acceptance — hence the stubs are real registry members, not absent.
