package agenthooks

// This file defines the per-host capability model for the opt-in "query the
// graph, don't grep your way around it" pre-tool nudge (#4238, #4276, #4297).
//
// BACKGROUND
// ----------
// The cross-host rules block (internal/install/rulesfiles) writes the standing
// directive into every IDE's project-context file (CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules,
// .windsurfrules, .codeium/instructions.md, .github/copilot-instructions.md).
// Every supported host therefore ALREADY carries the guidance as passive
// context.
//
// This package adds the ACTIVE reinforcement: a pre-tool hook that fires the
// moment a structural grep is about to run and nudges toward the grafel
// MCP. A pre-tool hook is only possible on hosts that expose a programmable
// pre-tool / pre-shell lifecycle surface. Most agent hosts do NOT. Rather than
// fabricate a hook API for a host that lacks one, each host honestly declares
// whether it supports a real pre-tool hook:
//
//   - SupportsHook() == true  → InstallHook writes a real, host-native hook.
//   - SupportsHook() == false → InstallHook is a documented no-op; the rules
//     file (written separately) carries the guidance. NoHookReason explains
//     why, so `doctor`/reporting can be honest about the gap.
//
// PER-HOST CAPABILITY MATRIX (honest, researched)
// -----------------------------------------------

//	Host          Pre-tool hook surface                         Hook?
//	-----------   -------------------------------------------   -----
//	Claude Code   .claude/settings.json PreToolUse (Bash/Grep)   YES
//	Cursor        .cursor/hooks.json beforeShellExecution        YES
//	Windsurf      rules + workflows, no pre-tool/-shell hook      no
//	Codeium       no programmable pre-tool hook API               no
//	Copilot       no programmable pre-tool hook API               no
//
// Adding a new host = implement Host and append it to Registry(). The shared
// NudgeScript (nudge.go) is reused verbatim by every hooking host so the
// behaviour (advisory-only, structural-heuristic, once-per-session) is
// identical across hosts.

// the ServiceManager / rulesfiles per-target pattern: a small interface with
// one implementation per host and a deterministic registry.
