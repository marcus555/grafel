// Package docgen — per-kind section profile framework (issue #1875).
//
// sectionsByKind maps entity kind strings to SectionProfile values so that
// each entity kind gets an explicit, curated section list instead of the
// flat 13-section default.  This is the unifying restructure that absorbs
// the piecewise section-gate work from #1860, #1863, #1865, #1866, #1870,
// #1873, #1882, #1883, #1869, #1870, and #1871.
//
// # Design
//
//   - SectionProfile.Sections is the ordered list that replaces the ad-hoc
//     switch in sectionsForEntityKind (tier1.go).
//   - SectionProfile.GuidanceOverrides lets a kind supply its own prompt text
//     for a section name without touching defaultSectionGuidance.  The override
//     takes effect in BuildBundle (llm_bundle.go) when the key matches.
//   - ResolveSectionProfile canonicalises the kind string and looks it up in
//     sectionsByKind, falling back to the "default" profile — which preserves
//     exactly the current 13-section behaviour for any kind not yet profiled.
//
// # Scope of this PR (#1875 Wave 1)
//
// Model, Module, and Operation profiles are landed here.
// View, Component, and Class profiles are follow-up PRs so that individual
// section-list decisions can be reviewed in isolation.
//
// # Section lists
//
// All Sections values must be drawn from KnownSections.  Sections that
// represent entirely new surface area (e.g. a dedicated "schema" section for
// Model) are introduced in follow-up PRs after KnownSections is extended.
// The GuidanceOverrides for the existing sections already carry Model-specific
// framing so the LLM output is correctly scoped even before a dedicated section
// is introduced.
//
// # Size-aware Operation profiles (#1986)
//
// ResolveSectionProfile accepts an optional lineCount variadic argument.
// When provided for an Operation kind, the profile is chosen from three tiers:
//
//   - small  (< 30 lines): skips reference-deployment, how-to-local-dev,
//     reference-scripts; uses shorter capabilities/api guidance.
//   - medium (30–149 lines): current guidance (baseline Operation profile).
//   - large  (>= 150 lines): full deep-context template with all sections.
