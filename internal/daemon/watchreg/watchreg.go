// Package watchreg is the daemon-owned registry of standalone `archigraph watch`
// child processes (issue #5142, follow-up to #5140/#5141).
//
// # Problem
//
// Pre-Phase-B, `archigraph watch <repo>` runs as a standalone launchd/systemd
// process. If its owning daemon dies/restarts, the watcher is orphaned. #5141
// gave the watcher a self-reap (exit after N consecutive daemon-unreachable
// failures), but that is best-effort and slow: a watcher that is wedged, paused,
// or whose daemon comes back on a different socket can linger. #5142 asks the
// daemon to OWN the lifecycle — track watcher PIDs and reap dead/orphaned ones.
//
// # Design
//
// Each standalone watcher writes a tiny JSON entry into a shared registry file
// under the daemon root (`~/.archigraph/watchers.json`) at startup and removes
// its own entry on clean exit. The daemon's reaper periodically:
//
//  1. drops entries whose PID is no longer alive (signal-0 probe), and
//  2. SIGTERMs + drops entries that are alive but ORPHANED — their recorded
//     owner daemon PID is no longer the live daemon (the daemon that restarted
//     adopts the file by stamping its own PID; any watcher still claiming the
//     old owner is a leftover from a previous daemon generation).
//
// The registry is a single JSON file guarded by an OS file lock for the
// read-modify-write, so concurrent watcher registrations and the daemon sweep
// never corrupt it. All process-touching operations (liveness, kill) are
// injectable so the staleness/reaping logic is unit-testable with fake PIDs.
