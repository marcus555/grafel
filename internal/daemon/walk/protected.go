// This file implements the shared "TCC guard" for the directory walk used by
// BOTH the indexer (WalkRepo) and the reactive watcher (subscribeRepo). It is
// defence-in-depth against the macOS privacy / TCC failure mode that triggered
// issue #5296: a registered repo path that walks into the user's protected
// media folders (~/Music, ~/Photos, ...) or into a *.musiclibrary /
// *.photoslibrary bundle causes macOS to pop a "grafel would like to access
// your Music / Photos / media library" permission prompt. A first-run public
// release must NEVER make a user see that prompt while indexing their code.
//
// Two distinct protections live here:
//
//  1. ProtectedHomeSubdir — a HARD refusal: if a directory path resolves
//     (symlinks followed) to be at or under one of the user's protected home
//     media folders, it is never entered. If a REGISTERED REPO ROOT itself
//     resolves into one of these, the caller refuses to index it with a WARN.
//
//  2. IsMediaLibraryBundle — a by-name skip for the macOS media-library
//     bundles (*.musiclibrary, *.photoslibrary, *.tvlibrary, ...) found
//     ANYWHERE in the tree. Descending into a *.photoslibrary is exactly what
//     triggers the Photos TCC prompt, so these are hard-skipped by basename
//     regardless of where they appear. The basename checks are harmless
//     cross-platform; the absolute-home checks are gated on darwin.

// protectedHomeBasenames are the top-level home subdirectories macOS protects
// behind TCC. Walking into any of them can trigger a privacy prompt. The list
// is intentionally small and constant so it is trivially auditable.
var protectedHomeBasenames = []string{
	"Music",
	"Photos",

// library; descending into it is what trips the Music/Photos TCC prompt.

// DefaultWatchDirCap is the default ceiling on the number of directories the
// watcher will subscribe to (and that the indexer treats as a "this is not a
// real code repo" tripwire) for a single repo. The live failure (#5296)
// registered 875 watch dirs on a 588MB non-code media tree — well under the
// original 5000 default, meaning the cap never actually caught its own
// origin case; the real media/asset protection is IsProtectedPath (the TCC
// guard) plus the .gitignore/.grafelignore/hardcoded-skip layers above,
// which stay in force regardless of this cap. Meanwhile a real large
// monorepo (measured: 9,120 directories) blew straight through the 5000
// default, silently truncating ~45% of the tree with no error. Raised to
// 100000 so legitimate large monorepos index fully while still keeping a
// high safety ceiling against genuinely pathological trees. Override via
// GRAFEL_WATCH_DIR_CAP.
