// orphanroot.go — orphan top-level store-root GC (issue #5263, epic #5234).
//
// # Problem
//
// The vanished-repo Reaper (reaper.go, #3680) only GCs the stores of repos the
// daemon is CURRENTLY TRACKING (registered repos + active worktree children)
// whose directory has disappeared. The dead-ref sweeper (deadref.go, #5236)
// only reclaims dead REFS *within* a still-present, still-tracked repo. Neither
// reclaims a top-level store root that is tracked by NOTHING anymore: a
// `<store>/<slug>-<hash>/` slot for a worktree/repo that was indexed once, then
// removed from the registry (or whose worktree was deleted) so it never appears
// in TrackedRepos again. On acme-backend-v3 the live store grew to ~12GB across
// 357 top-level roots, most of them such orphans.
//
// # The store-root ↔ source-path mapping (the key design decision)
//
// A root is `<store>/<slug>-<hash>` where hash = sha256(canonical(absPath))[:16]
// (see state_path.go). The hash is ONE-WAY and roots do NOT self-record their
// source path on disk (graph.json carries only a human label + is_worktree, not
// the absolute path). So there is NO authoritative reverse mapping from a root
// back to a filesystem path.
//
// Therefore attribution is done in the FORWARD direction: enumerate every KNOWN
// source path (registered-group repos + their git worktrees — both still-present
// AND already-vanished), compute RepoBaseDir(path) for each, and build a map
// root → source path. An on-disk root is then attributed as:
//
//   - maps to a known path that STILL EXISTS  → KEEP (live).
//   - maps to a known path that is GONE        → ORPHAN candidate (reapable).
//   - maps to NO known path                    → source path UNDETERMINABLE →
//     KEEP (fail-closed).
//
// # Guards (mirror the ref-GC safety model exactly — do not over-delete)
//
//   - A root whose source path still exists is NEVER reaped.
//   - A root mapping to a registered/live group repo (or its primary) is NEVER
//     reaped — such a path is in the known set and (if present) exists.
//   - Grace window: a root whose newest graph artifact mtime is within
//     GraceWindow (default 24h) is kept, so an in-flight / just-finished index
//     pass is never raced into deletion.
//   - Fail-closed: if a root cannot be attributed to a known source path, or
//     its liveness is otherwise undeterminable, it is KEPT and logged — never
//     reaped. The store-root base being unreadable skips the whole sweep.
//
// This is intentionally conservative so it is safe to run continuously while
// the daemon serves the rewrite agent. When in doubt, KEEP.
