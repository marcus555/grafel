// group_cancel.go — per-group rebuild cancellation registry.
//
// The scheduler owns cancellation of its OWN background passes (group-algo,
// links, per-repo reindex) via Scheduler.CancelGroup. But the heavy GROUP
// REBUILD — the multi-minute loop in cmd/grafel's daemonRebuildFuncCore that
// force-indexes every member repo and then runs the cross-repo link/phantom
// passes — runs OUTSIDE the scheduler: it is driven by RebuildFunc, whose
// signature takes no context (it is invoked identically from Service.Rebuild in
// monolith/engine mode and from the engine's rebuild-drain worker in split
// mode). Before this registry, a `grafel delete <group>` removed the group from
// the registry but left that rebuild loop churning to completion — the daemon
// stayed pinned at 100%+ CPU for minutes after the group was gone.
//
// This registry gives the rebuild a per-group context.Context WITHOUT changing
// the RebuildFunc signature (which threads through ~a dozen call/test sites):
// daemonRebuildFuncCore calls GroupRebuildContext(group) to obtain (and
// register) a cancelable context plus an `end` cleanup func, checks ctx.Err()
// between repos and threads it into the per-repo index + link passes, and calls
// end() on return. Service.DeleteGroup (and the engine's KindCancelGroup drain
// handler) call CancelGroupRebuild(group) to interrupt it.
//
// Cancel-before-register (split mode): the engine drain dispatches a pending
// KindRebuild to the async rebuildWorker (non-blocking) and may then apply a
// KindCancelGroup INLINE before that worker goroutine has called
// GroupRebuildContext, so CancelGroupRebuild finds nothing to cancel and returns
// false. That residual race is NOT closed here with a tombstone — a tombstone
// planted on every delete (including the common delete-of-an-idle-group case)
// would make a recreate of the same name consume it and start already-cancelled,
// spuriously killing the recreate's first rebuild ("delete api; recreate api").
// Instead it is closed DETERMINISTICALLY one layer up: daemonRebuildFuncCore
// re-reads the registry immediately after registering its context and aborts
// with "unknown group" when the group is absent (see cmd/grafel/daemon.go). A
// stale rebuild for a genuinely-deleted group therefore aborts before any heavy
// work, while a recreate re-registers the group so its own rebuild's existence
// check passes — no false-cancel.
//
// Stale end()/prev overwrite (rapid delete→recreate of the same group name): an
// old rebuild's deferred end() must not delete the NEW rebuild's entry.
// Registration returns an identity TOKEN; end() only deletes the entry when it
// is still that token's, and a re-registration defensively cancels any stale
// predecessor.

// groupRebuildEntry is the identity token for one registered group rebuild.
