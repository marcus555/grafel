// Package sched is the daemon's reactive scheduler (Phase B+). The
// watcher hands off settled-repo notifications to Enqueue; the
// scheduler serialises per-repo indexes, runs them on a small worker
// pool, then schedules:
//
//   - a debounced cross-repo link recompute per group (10s),
//   - optionally, a debounced graph-algorithm pass per repo (30s) — only
//     when GRAFEL_EAGER_ALGO=true (S2 of #2149). By default the algo
//     pass is suppressed here; rank-sensitive MCP tools trigger it on-demand
//     via the algo.Cache path instead.
//
// The link recompute and algorithm pass run via caller-supplied callbacks so
// the scheduler stays free of extractor + graph package dependencies.
//
// Concurrency cap (post-#644): the scheduler now applies RSS-budget
// admission control on top of the worker pool. Before a queued job
// is dispatched to a worker, the scheduler checks that
//
//	sum(predicted RSS of currently-running jobs) + predicted RSS of
//	the new job <= BudgetMB
//
// If the budget would be exceeded the job stays in the pending queue
// and is retried as soon as a running job completes. This prevents
// the post-#639 concurrent-3-repo peak (672MB) from blowing past the
// 500MB target on the real-fixture benchmark.
//
// Ref-aware indexing (PH1b of epic #2087 / issue #2089):
// The scheduler now captures the current HEAD ref at Enqueue time (via
// RefCaptureFn) and passes it to IndexFn. This ensures that a debounced
// batch that fires after a branch switch indexes against the ref that was
// current when the event was first enqueued (i.e. the user's intent at
// the moment of the change), not the ref at eventual dispatch time.
//
// Branch-switch events (from the GitHeadPoller) use EnqueueRef directly,
// supplying the new ref that the poller already observed — no extra git
// call needed.

// as a high-water mark and only madvise()s it back to the OS lazily. On a

// 5.5GB swapped, only 176MB actually resident). FreeOSMemory forces the GC +
// scavenge so the OS reclaims the pages instead of swapping them.
//
// Why debounced (not per-index): FreeOSMemory is a synchronous
// stop-the-world GC followed by a scavenge — expensive. The daemon reindexes
