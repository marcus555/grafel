// Package sched is the daemon's reactive scheduler (Phase B+). The
// watcher hands off settled-repo notifications to Enqueue; the
// scheduler serialises per-repo indexes, runs them on a small worker
// pool, then schedules:
//
//   - a debounced cross-repo link recompute per group (10s),
//   - a debounced GROUP-scope graph-algorithm pass (30s), chained off the
//     SUCCESS path of the link pass (#5349 A3, epic #5350). Algorithms now run
//     ONCE over the assembled group union — so cross-repo edges are finally
//     seen — and write the <group>-algo.json overlay. This replaces the old
//     per-repo algo pass (a single-repo group is the degenerate one-repo
//     union). N repo reindexes → 1 link pass → 1 group-algo pass.
//
// The link recompute and group-algorithm pass run via caller-supplied callbacks
// so the scheduler stays free of extractor + graph package dependencies.
//
// Concurrency cap (post-#644): the scheduler now applies RSS-budget
// admission control on top of the worker pool. Before a queued job
// is dispatched to a worker, the scheduler checks that
//
//	sum(predicted RSS of currently-running jobs) + predicted RSS of
//	the new job <= BudgetMB
//
// If the budget would be exceeded the job stays in the pending queue
// and is retried as soon as a running job completes. This prevents
// the post-#639 concurrent-3-repo peak (672MB) from blowing past the
// 500MB target on the real-fixture benchmark.
//
// Ref-aware indexing (PH1b of epic #2087 / issue #2089):
// The scheduler now captures the current HEAD ref at Enqueue time (via
// RefCaptureFn) and passes it to IndexFn. This ensures that a debounced
// batch that fires after a branch switch indexes against the ref that was
// current when the event was first enqueued (i.e. the user's intent at
// the moment of the change), not the ref at eventual dispatch time.
//
// Branch-switch events (from the GitHeadPoller) use EnqueueRef directly,
// supplying the new ref that the poller already observed — no extra git
// call needed.
