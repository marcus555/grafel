// Package indexstate is a tiny, dependency-free, process-global record of
// whether the daemon currently has a reindex in flight. It exists so the
// in-daemon MCP server (internal/mcp) can surface an `is_indexing` flag in
// grafel_stats without holding a reference to the scheduler (internal/daemon/
// sched) — wiring the live scheduler into the MCP server would create an
// import cycle, since internal/mcp imports internal/daemon for layout paths.
//
// Both the scheduler (writer) and the MCP stats handler (reader) import this
// leaf package. The scheduler calls Set(n) under its lock whenever the number
// of in-flight index jobs changes; readers call Snapshot() for a lock-free,
// race-free view.
//
// Motivation: the dogfooding report (P5) asked for a way to query indexing
// state via grafel_stats instead of polling `ps aux` for hot grafel processes.
