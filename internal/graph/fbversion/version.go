// Package fbversion holds the single source of truth for the on-disk
// FlatBuffers format version written by internal/graph/fbwriter and
// read (with a minimum-version gate) by internal/graph/load.go.
//
// This is intentionally a leaf package with no imports so that both
// internal/graph (load.go) and internal/graph/fbwriter can import it
// without creating an import cycle.
package fbversion

// Version is the on-disk FB format version that fbwriter writes and
// load expects. Bump together with any schema change in graph.fbs that
// breaks readers. Both internal/graph and internal/graph/fbwriter
// import this package — drift is now compile-time impossible.
