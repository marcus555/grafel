// Package statusfile is the engine↔consumer status-plane sidecar (#5725
// core, #5729-W1). It exists so a statusline / CLI / future serve process can
// answer "what is grafel doing for THIS repo right now?" with a fast,
// non-blocking, always-terminating file read — never a daemon RPC that can
// block behind an in-flight index.
//
// The daemon (engine) is the SOLE writer: it atomically (tmp+rename) writes
// one small JSON file per repo to
//
//	$GRAFEL_HOME/status/<sha256(abs_repo_path)[:16]>.json
//
// (GRAFEL_HOME defaults to ~/.grafel; honors the same override as
// internal/registry.HomeDir). The file is updated whenever that repo's index
// state changes (start/complete/dirty) and on a periodic heartbeat so a
// reader can also detect an engine that died mid-index (stale HeartbeatAt).
//
// A reader (grafel status --json, a statusline, or the future standalone
// `serve` process per ADR-0024) calls Read, which does a single os.ReadFile —
// no socket dial, no lock, no RPC. If the file is absent or stale the reader
// falls back to "unknown" rather than hanging.
