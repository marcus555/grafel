// auth_posture_conflict_test.go — reconcile regression for the contradictory
// auth-posture dual badge (#auth-posture-conflict).
//
// The dashboard security/auth-coverage panel computes its own has_auth verdict
// via hasAuthProperty. Before the fix it read only the raw per-method signal
// keys (auth_decorator/auth_middleware/auth_annotation) and so reported NO-AUTH
// for a route gated only by an INHERITED controller/global guard — even though
// the engine had already reconciled it to auth_required=true and the posture
// surface showed it authenticated. These tests feed the EXACT property shape the
// engine stamps and assert the panel agrees.
