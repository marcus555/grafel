// pass_signature_guard_test.go — compile-time enforcement that every
// top-level engine detector pass uses the canonical DetectorPassArgs →
// DetectorPassResult signature introduced by PR #2497.
//
// Background: PR #2497 standardised all engine passes to accept a single
// DetectorPassArgs struct and return DetectorPassResult. Several test
// call sites were missed and silently left using the old ad-hoc positional
// signature, causing `go vet ./...` failures. Those were fixed in PR #2503
// as a side-effect (closes #2509).
//
// This file prevents the regression from recurring: any pass whose
// signature drifts from func(DetectorPassArgs) DetectorPassResult will
// produce a compile-time type mismatch here, making `go build ./...` (and
// therefore the pre-commit gate) fail immediately rather than silently.
package engine

// passSignature is the canonical type that every top-level engine detector
// pass must satisfy.
type passSignature = func(DetectorPassArgs) DetectorPassResult

// _ is a blank-identifier compile-time assertion. The composite literal
// below must type-check as []passSignature. If any function listed here
// has the wrong signature, the build fails with a clear type-mismatch
// error pointing at the offending pass.
//
// Keep this list in the same order as the applyPass call sequence in
// detector.go's Detect method so it is easy to audit against that file.
