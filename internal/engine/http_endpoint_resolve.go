// Phase-2 post-pass for the synthetic http_endpoint entities emitted by
// http_endpoint_synthesis.go.
//
// Phase 1 emits one synthetic http_endpoint per route with a
// `source_handler` property of the form "<HandlerKind>:<HandlerName>"
// but deliberately does NOT emit edges to the handler. Emitting unresolved
// edges in Phase 1 inflated bug-rate because every dangling target counts
// as a resolver failure.
//
// Phase 2 (this file) runs AFTER the merged entity table is assembled but
// BEFORE EntityIDs are stamped. It:
//
//  1. Builds a (kind, name, sourceFile) → record-pointer index over the
//     merged set.
//  2. For each synthetic http_endpoint with a source_handler property
//     (producer side):
//     a. Parses the property into (handlerKind, handlerName).
//     b. Resolves to a real entity in the same SourceFile (handlers and
//     their owning routes always live in the same file by construction
//     of Phase 1).
//     c. If resolved: appends an IMPLEMENTS edge (handler → synthetic)
//     to the handler's embedded Relationships, then clears the
//     source_handler property (its job is done).
//     d. If NOT resolved: marks the synthetic for removal so it never
//     reaches the resolver as an orphan.
//  3. For each synthetic http_endpoint with a source_caller property
//     (consumer side, #754):
//     a. Parses the property into (callerKind, callerName).
//     b. Resolves to a real entity in the same SourceFile (the JS/TS
//     and Python consumer extractors stamp the enclosing function's
//     NAME on each emitted endpoint, and that function lives in the
//     same file by construction).
//     c. If resolved: appends a FETCHES edge (caller → synthetic) to
//     the caller's embedded Relationships, then clears the
//     source_caller property. This wires the consumer-side
//     http_endpoint into the per-repo graph so the process-flow BFS
//     (#724) can traverse from the caller into the bridge node, and
//     the cross-stack detector (#754) can fire correctly when the
//     chain crosses a repo boundary. Without this edge, the 41
//     consumer endpoints on fixture-e remained structural orphans
//     and no fixture-e Process was ever marked cross_stack=true.
//     d. If NOT resolved: the synthetic is kept (consumer endpoints
//     are valuable cross-repo bridges regardless of caller resolution)
//     but no FETCHES edge is emitted.
//
// Returning a NEW slice of EntityRecords (with unresolved producer
// synthetics dropped) keeps the data flow obvious and avoids in-place
// slice shuffling at the call site.

	// controllers). Those properties already encode the handler → DTO
	// direction implicitly. But the inverse — "which handlers consume this
	// DTO?" — is not directly walkable from the DTO node. Without it, the
	// dashboard flows section has to text-scan source_window content of
	// every handler to reconstruct the linkage.
	//
	// This pass walks every http_endpoint_definition with a non-empty
	// {request,response}_body_type, resolves the DTO simple name to a
	// candidate Schema / Component / Model in the merged set, and appends a
	// REFERENCES edge FROM the DTO TO the handler (the inverse direction).
	// The edge is annotated with reference_kind = "request_body" or
	// "response_body" so downstream consumers can filter the surfacing.
	//
	// Resolution heuristic: first lookup by (kind, name) using globalIdx for
	// the same handler kind family; failing that, scan globalIdx for any
	// entity whose Name == typeName and whose Kind looks DTO-ish
	// (SCOPE.Component, SCOPE.Schema, Model, Schema, DTO, Component). We
