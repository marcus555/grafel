// Package engine — dependency-boundary annotation pass (#3638, epic #3625).
//
// This pass promotes the previously-orphaned lib_boundary enricher
// (internal/enrichers/lib_boundary_enricher.go — a Go port of the Python
// lib_boundary_enricher.py that was imported by zero production code) into a
// live, registered project-scope pass. It annotates every dependency /import
// DEPENDS_ON edge with a boundary signal:
//
//   - boundary=first_party  — the target is internal to this org/module: a
//     local/relative import, or a code-to-code dependency between two entities
//     that both live in this repo (neither end is an external manifest dep).
//   - boundary=third_party  — the target is an external library: a manifest
//     dependency (DEPENDS_ON kind=external_dependency) or a non-local import
//     resolved to an external package.
//
// WHY. The first_party / third_party split is a rewrite-scope signal: code
// inside a rewrite boundary is first_party (you own it, you can change it),
// whereas third_party edges cross an org boundary into a vendored library (you
// can swap it but not rewrite it). Persisting it onto the graph lets
// find/neighbors/agents reason about rewrite scope without re-deriving it.
//
// REUSE, DO NOT RE-PARSE. The classification is read entirely off properties the
// extractors already attached to each edge:
//
//   - cross/manifest emits DEPENDS_ON{kind=external_dependency} for declared
//     manifest deps                                            → third_party.
//   - cross/imports emits DEPENDS_ON{kind=import, is_local, external_dependency}
//     where is_local distinguishes a relative/internal import (first_party)
//     from a resolved external package (third_party).
//   - language extractors emit DEPENDS_ON code-to-code edges (struct field,
//     receiver, …). When NEITHER endpoint is an external_dependency entity the
//     dependency is internal → first_party.
//
// No source is re-read and no manifest is re-parsed; this pass runs after the
// document is assembled and mutates existing edges (and external_dependency
// entities, for parity) in place — no new entities, no double emit.
//
// HONEST-PARTIAL. When an edge's origin is genuinely ambiguous (a DEPENDS_ON
// whose kind/locality cannot be determined and whose endpoints are not both
// resolvable in this document), the pass leaves it UNANNOTATED rather than
// guessing. The boundary property is therefore present only where the signal is
// real; its absence reads as "unknown", not "first_party".
