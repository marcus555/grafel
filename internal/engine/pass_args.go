// Package engine — shared arg/result types for engine detector passes.
//
// Every pass called from detector.go's Detect method is refactored to accept
// DetectorPassArgs and return DetectorPassResult.  The structs carry the full
// set of inputs any pass may need; passes that don't use a field simply ignore
// it.  This eliminates the previous ad-hoc positional signatures and fixes the
// asymmetry introduced by PR #2444 (#2430), where applyORMFieldEdges was the
// only pass that returned bare relationships instead of (entities, relationships).
//
// Fields:
//
//   - Ctx           — context for passes that spawn spans or do I/O (Spring,
//     Django route composition).
//   - Lang          — file language tag ("python", "go", "java", …).
//   - Path          — repo-relative file path.
//   - RepoRoot      — absolute filesystem path of the repo root (Kafka edges).
//   - Content       — raw file bytes.
//   - Pass1Entities — side-channel with Pass 1 per-file entities (ORM field
//     edges, see #2352).
//   - Entities      — entities accumulated so far in the Detect pipeline.
//   - Relationships — relationships accumulated so far in the Detect pipeline.
//
// Refs #2446.
