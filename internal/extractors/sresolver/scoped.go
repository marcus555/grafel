// Package sresolver implements the partial (scoped) resolver pass for the S3
// incremental file-level reindex (issue #2153 of epic #2149).
//
// This package is intentionally kept separate from internal/resolve to avoid
// an import cycle: internal/resolve's integration tests import internal/extractors,
// and internal/extractors/incremental.go imports this package.
//
// # Purpose
//
// After the per-file extraction step removes stale entities and adds freshly
// extracted ones, some relationships in the surviving graph may point TO
// entities that were just renamed, removed, or re-keyed. The scoped resolver
// re-examines:
//
//  1. Outbound relationships FROM newly extracted entities (already in newRels).
//  2. Inbound relationships in the EXISTING graph that point TO any of the
//     newly extracted entities' names — these need their ToID updated if the
//     entity's stable ID changed.
//
// If any inbound relationship points to a name that is from a re-extracted file
// but is NO LONGER present in newEntities (deleted entity), we set
// FallbackRequired = true so the caller falls back to a full reindex.
//
// # Signature-change incremental (#2170)
//
// When an entity's Signature or Properties changed (detected by the caller via
// entityPropertiesHash comparison), the caller supplies the changed entity IDs
// via WithSignatureChangedIDs. The resolver builds a reverse index
// (toID → []Relationship) over the existing relationships and re-resolves
// inbound CALLS/REFERENCES edges for those IDs in the scoped pass, avoiding
// the safety-net full-reindex fallback for pure signature changes.

// Parameters:
//   - newEntities: entities freshly extracted from the changed files.
//   - existingEntities: entities from the surviving (unchanged-file) portion of the graph.
//   - newRels: relationships extracted alongside newEntities (outbound from changed files).
//   - existingRels: relationships from the surviving graph (inbound + cross-file).
//   - logger: may be nil.
//   - opts: optional functional options (e.g. WithSignatureChangedIDs).
//
// The resolver builds a name → ID index over newEntities ∪ existingEntities
// and uses it to:
//
//  1. Rewrite stub ToIDs in newRels from bare names to entity IDs where possible.
//  2. Walk existingRels for inbound edges with stub ToIDs targeting newly-extracted
//     entity names: update their ToID when the name resolves to a new ID.
//  3. Detect the safety-net case: an existingRel stub ToID matches the source-file
//     set of re-extracted files but is NOT in newEntities (deleted entity/file).
//  4. Re-resolve inbound CALLS/REFERENCES for signature-changed entities (#2170):
//     build a reverse index and update edges rather than falling back.
