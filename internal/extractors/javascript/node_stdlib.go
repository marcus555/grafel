// Package javascript — Node.js stdlib receiver classification (Refs #44).
//
// Background
// ----------
// The receiver-typed CALLS path in receiver.go (issue #421) only fires when
// the receiver's static type resolves to a relative import (project-internal
// file). Node.js stdlib calls are the dominant residual bug-extractor cohort
// in TS/JS scripts (e.g. starter-workflows at ~12.42%):
//
//	import * as path from "path";
//	import fs from "node:fs";
//
//	function f() { return path.join(a, b); }      // bare CALLS -> "join"
//	function g() { return fs.readFileSync(p); }   // bare CALLS -> "readFileSync"
//
// Both calls land in the bug-extractor because (a) the receiver-typed path
// requires a relative import and (b) the bare leaf names ("join",
// "readFileSync", ...) are deliberately omitted from `jsBareNames` to avoid
// collisions with user method names in other ecosystems.
//
// Fix
// ---
// When the callee is a member_expression `<recv>.<method>` and `<recv>` is a
// bare identifier whose IMPORTS binding maps to a known Node.js stdlib
// module spec (`"path"`, `"fs"`, `"node:path"`, ...), emit a cross-language
// "external" structural-ref stub keyed on the canonical `node:<module>`
// name. The synth pass (`internal/external/synth.go`'s `:external:` branch)
// canonicalises that to the `node:<module>` allowlist key and routes the
// edge to a single `ext:node:<module>` placeholder — matching the per-
// module collapse used by Go stdlib interface dispatch (#364) and the
// cross-language external-import branch.
//
// Same shape covers the bare-named-import case
// (`import { join } from "path"`); the call appears as a bare identifier
// `join` and the import binding still maps `join` → `"path"`. That branch
// is exercised by classifyBareNodeStdlibCall.
//
// Conservative bias
// -----------------
// The allowlist below contains ONLY canonical Node.js stdlib module specs.
// User-named imports from third-party packages (`import { join } from
// "lodash"`) do not match (`"lodash"` isn't in the set), so the existing
// bare-name / receiver-type collisions are unchanged. Mis-classification
// risk is bounded by the import spec; we never inspect method names.
