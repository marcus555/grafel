// Package cross hosts the cross-language extractors and exposes a registry
// of all such extractors so the indexer's Pass 3 (cross-language extraction)
// can iterate over them without hard-coding the list.
//
// Each cross-language extractor lives in a sub-package and registers itself
// against the global extractor registry under a "_cross_<name>" key in its
// init() function. AllExtractors() returns the canonical ordered slice of
// (name, extractor) pairs the indexer should run during Pass 3.
