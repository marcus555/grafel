// dashboard_api.go — exported, request-envelope-free entry points that let the
// dashboard backend reuse the EXACT posture + effective-contract computation the
// grafel_endpoint_posture and grafel_effective_contract MCP tools run
// (#4254, epic #4249).
//
// Both surfaces (the MCP tool and the dashboard Paths detail pane) MUST agree
// byte-for-byte on what an endpoint's posture / a ViewSet's per-verb contract
// is. The only way to guarantee that is for both to call the same code. The MCP
// handlers operate on the internal *LoadedRepo / *LoadedGroup model, which the
// dashboard does not hold — but a LoadedRepo needs nothing more than a repo slug
// and a *graph.Document (every derived index builds lazily on first use). So
// these helpers wrap the dashboard's already-loaded graph.Documents into a
// throwaway LoadedGroup and delegate to buildPosturePayload /
// computeEffectiveContract.
//
// The returned types (PosturePayload, EffectiveContractResult, ...) are exported
// aliases of the internal wire structs, so the dashboard serialises the IDENTICAL
// JSON shape the MCP tools emit — no re-derivation, no drift.
