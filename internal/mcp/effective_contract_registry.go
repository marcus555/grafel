// effective_contract_registry.go — the framework-PLUGGABLE effective-contract
// resolver registry (#4601).
//
// grafel_effective_contract was DRF-only: computeEffectiveContract found a
// ViewSet's drf_router_expanded routes and projected the engine-stamped
// effective_* props (effective_contract.go / effective_contract_tool.go). For
// any non-DRF stack — notably the NestJS upvate-v3 rewrite — it returned an
// empty result, so the rewrite agent could not get a per-endpoint full contract
// from the tool and fell back to scraping the dashboard.
//
// This file generalises the tool into a registry of per-framework resolvers.
// Each resolver composes the SAME contract structure (status set, request
// fields, per-branch response shapes, auth) from signals that ALREADY exist on
// the graph for its framework — nothing is re-extracted. The DRF path is
// preserved BYTE-FOR-BYTE: computeEffectiveContract still runs the DRF
// router-expanded + class-fallback synthesis first, and the registry resolvers
// only run when that produced nothing for the target (so an index that already
// resolves under DRF is unchanged).
//
// Adding Spring / FastAPI / Express / … is a matter of registering one more
// contractResolver (follow-up tickets ref #4601); the diff/parity consumers
// downstream never change because every resolver emits the shared
// effectiveContract shape.
