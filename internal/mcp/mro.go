// mro.go — MRO-aware member resolution for grafel_get_source /
// grafel_inspect (epic #3829, ticket #3833 — PR A3).
//
// Problem (the rewrite agent's G2): when a class inherits a member it never
// declares — a DRF `RoleViewSet(ModelViewSet)` inherits `retrieve` from
// `rest_framework.mixins.RetrieveModelMixin`, a Go struct promotes an
// embedded type's method — `get_source` and `inspect` previously resolved the
// entity to the SUBCLASS file (or a bodyless synthetic with only a signature)
// and stopped there. The caller never saw the DEFINING base body, the default
// status, or even an indication that the member was inherited.
//
// resolveMember closes that gap. Given an entity that is an inherited member
// (a bodyless DRF synthetic `SCOPE.Operation`, or a method whose owning class
// declares it only via an inherited_methods annotation), it walks the owning
// class's EXTENDS edges to find the DEFINING class:
//
//   (a) an INDEXED base class in the same repo that declares the member with a
//       real body  -> resolve to that entity's body span (provenance
//       inheritedInRepo), OR
//   (b) an EXTERNAL library base the baseknowledge pack knows (DRF mixins,
//       ...) -> synthesize an "external body" stub from the pack contract
//       (defining class FQN, default status, behaviour, doc URL), provenance
//       inheritedExternal.
//
// HONEST-PARTIAL (quality-first): when the member cannot be tied to a defining
// class — unknown base, not in the pack, no in-repo declaration — resolveMember
// returns an UNRESOLVED result and the callers fall back to the current
// behaviour. It NEVER fabricates a body or a status.
//
// This is a pure read-path resolver; it adds no graph entities or edges. The
// indexer-side INHERITS/OVERRIDES edge is a separate ticket (PR A2 #3832-era);
// this PR is the MCP projection (DEPLOY-DEFERRED: needs a daemon rebuild to
// serve).
