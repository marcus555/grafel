name: archigraph-security-audit
description: Two-phase security audit of the indexed group. Phase 1 is deterministic static analysis (runs inside the indexer via internal/security/). Phase 2 is LLM-driven semantic confirmation, ranking, and explanation — adds SecurityFinding entities to the graph and emits a security/ doc tier. Interactive by default; --auto for CI.
when-to-use: User asks to "audit security", "find security issues", "run the security check", "check for auth gaps", or invokes /archigraph-security-audit explicitly. Best run after /archigraph-resolve (orphan endpoints produce false negatives in auth coverage). /archigraph-tech-docs output is optional soft context for Phase 2.

# archigraph-security-audit

Run a two-phase security audit against the indexed archigraph group.

- **Phase 1 — Static analysis** (`prompts/01-static-analysis.md`): deterministic rule-based checks run against the graph. Finds missing auth decorators, publicly reachable endpoints with no permission check, orphan routes, exposed PII fields, and other structural patterns. Includes the Phase 2B taint-flow analysis (#2772) — `archigraph_security_findings` returns source→sink paths through the CALLS graph that lack an intervening sanitizer, ranked by confidence (default floor 0.7). Essentially free — no LLM calls.
- **Phase 2 — LLM semantic pass** (`prompts/02-semantic-confirmation.md`): LLM-driven confirmation, ranking, and explanation. Confirms or dismisses Phase 1 findings, adds severity scores, writes human-readable explanations, and surfaces findings the static pass missed. Interactive by default — the user reviews findings before they are submitted to the graph.

## When to use this skill

- "Audit security for this group."
- "Find auth gaps / missing permission checks."
- "Run a security check before the release."
- `/archigraph-security-audit` (slash command).

Do **not** invoke for code quality, documentation, or enrichment — those are separate skills.

## Prerequisites

- A running archigraph daemon with the group indexed.
- Recommended: run `/archigraph-resolve` first — orphan endpoints (unresolved edges) produce false-negative auth coverage results.
- Optional (improves Phase 2 fidelity): `/archigraph-tech-docs` output — the LLM gets module README context so it understands what a handler is supposed to do before judging whether it has adequate auth.

## CRITICAL TOOL DISCIPLINE

Use archigraph MCP tools for ALL graph navigation: `archigraph_whoami`, `archigraph_find`, `archigraph_inspect`, `archigraph_expand`, `archigraph_traces`. Do NOT grep source for structural questions.

### Pre-flight assertion

Call `archigraph_whoami` first. If it errors: ABORT with "archigraph MCP not configured. Run `/mcp` to fix."

## Cost and mode

| Phase | LLM | Cost | Default |
|-------|-----|------|---------|
| Phase 1 (static) | None | ~$0 | Always runs |
| Phase 2 (semantic) | Haiku (most findings), Sonnet (critical) | ~100k–500k tokens | Interactive by default |

**`--auto` flag:** skips interactive confirmation in Phase 2; all findings above `confidence=0.7` are auto-submitted to the graph. Use for CI pipelines.
**`--phase1-only` flag:** run only Phase 1 and emit the static report without LLM Phase 2.
**`--since <sha>` flag:** restrict Phase 1 to entities changed since the given commit (delta mode for CI gates).

## Phase 1 — Static analysis

Follow `prompts/01-static-analysis.md`. Key checks:

0. **Taint-flow security findings (#2772)** — call `archigraph_security_findings(min_confidence=0.7)` first. Each finding is a source→sink path through the CALLS graph (request input / env var / deserialised JSON reaches SQL exec / shell exec / eval / regex constructor / file write / HTML output without an intervening sanitizer). The pass is deterministic, conservative (drops anything below 0.5 confidence), and language-aware across T1 (jsts, python, java, go). Treat every finding ≥0.85 confidence as a Phase 2 candidate by default; findings 0.7-0.85 deserve LLM confirmation. Categories surfaced: `sql_injection`, `command_injection`, `path_traversal`, `xss`, `redos`, `deserialization`, `ssrf`.
1. **Auth coverage** — for every `http_endpoint` entity, check whether the graph contains an `AUTHENTICATED_BY` or `REQUIRES_PERMISSION` edge. Endpoints with no such edge are flagged `auth_missing`.
2. **Reachability** — identify endpoints reachable from the public internet (no internal-only marker) with `auth_missing`. These become `severity=high` findings.
3. **Orphan endpoints** — endpoints with no callers AND no auth edge. Could be dead code or unauthenticated surface.
4. **PII exposure** — entities of kind `DataField` tagged `pii=true` that are returned by an unauthenticated endpoint.
5. **Overly broad permissions** — permission checks that resolve to `*` or `admin_only` when the endpoint clearly only needs a scoped permission.
6. **Residual edges on security-sensitive paths** — any endpoint that has an unresolved outbound edge (detected via `archigraph_repairs(action=list)`) on a path marked as authentication-related.

Each finding gets a fingerprint: `sha256(entity_id + check_name)`. The fingerprint is stable across re-runs so re-running doesn't create duplicate findings.

Output: `~/.archigraph/groups/<group>/archigraph-security-audit/phase1-findings.json`.

## Phase 2 — LLM semantic pass

Follow `prompts/02-semantic-confirmation.md`. For each Phase 1 finding:

1. Load the entity's `archigraph_expand(node=<id>, depth=2)` for neighbour context.
2. If `/archigraph-tech-docs` output exists for the entity's module, load the relevant section.
3. Ask the LLM: is this finding a real security issue, a false positive, or needs-more-info? Assign `severity` (critical/high/medium/low/info) and write a human-readable `explanation`.
4. Present to the user for confirmation (unless `--auto`).
5. On confirmation: call `archigraph_save_finding(type="security_finding", ...)` to persist. In interactive mode, the user can dismiss, escalate, or edit the severity before submission.

Output: per-finding markdown pages at `~/.archigraph/docs/<group>/security/`.

## archigraph MCP tool surface

- `archigraph_whoami`, `archigraph_find`, `archigraph_inspect`, `archigraph_expand`
- `archigraph_security_findings` — Phase 2B taint-flow source→sink findings (#2772). Args: `category`, `min_confidence` (default 0.7), `limit`, `source_repo`. Returns deterministic SecurityFinding records ranked by confidence.
- `archigraph_repairs` — check for residual edges on security-sensitive paths
- `archigraph_enrichments` — read enriched endpoint metadata
- `archigraph_save_finding` — promote a confirmed finding to a first-class `security_finding` record. Args: `question`, `answer` (required); `type="security_finding"`, `nodes=["<entity_id>"]`, `repo_filter` (optional). It does NOT accept `entity_id`/`severity` top-level — carry the entity in `nodes` and severity in the question/answer text.
- `archigraph_list_findings` — load prior findings to avoid duplicates. Pass `type="security_finding"` to query only promoted security findings, or `entity_id=<id>` to find findings touching a specific entity.

After auditing, run the full consultant panel or review specific personas:
-> `/archigraph-consult` — panel of specialist personas; the security-auditor persona deduplicates against these findings rather than re-deriving them.
