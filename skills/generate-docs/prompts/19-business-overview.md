# Pass 19 — Business overview / landing page (BUSINESS tier)

The last business pass. Produce the single landing page a PM opens first: what
the product does, who uses it, and an index into the capabilities, journeys,
domain glossary, and rules written by Passes 15–18. It runs last because it
links to everything those passes produced.

> **READ FIRST:** `snippets/business-voice.md`. Binding.

Synthesised across the whole group.

## Inputs

- `~/.archigraph/groups/<group>/domain.md`.
- The business pages written by Passes 15–18 (glossary, capabilities/*,
  journeys/*, rules/index.md) — you index all of them.

## Output

```
<primary-repo>/docs/business/overview.md
```

Use `output-templates/business-overview.md`. This is the root of the Business
view the webui surfaces (#1634): the chooser's "Business" tab lands here.

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Write the pitch

Two or three plain-language paragraphs: what the product is, the problem it
solves, who it serves. Lift the framing from `domain.md`, translated to business
voice. No component names.

### Step 2 — Build the indexes

- **Who uses it** — table of user types and their goals.
- **What it does** — one bullet per capability page from Pass 16, each a
  business sentence linking to `capabilities/<slug>.md`.
- **Core ideas** — point at `domain-glossary.md`.
- **How a typical job flows** — one bullet per journey from Pass 17 linking to
  `journeys/<slug>.md`.
- **Rules the product enforces** — 2–3 headline rules + link to `rules/index.md`.

Every link must resolve (the page must already exist from Passes 15–18) — apply
`snippets/link-hygiene.md`. Do not link to a capability/journey that was not
written.

### Step 3 — Anchors + provenance

Headings first, derive `anchors:` per `snippets/anchor-contract.md`. Provenance
in the collapsed `<details>` block.

### Step 4 — Verify + save

Run `snippets/verification-checklist.md`, then run the business-tier link check:
confirm every link from `overview.md` resolves to a file that exists under
`business/`.

```
archigraph_save_finding(
  question="What is the business overview of the <group> group?",
  answer="<file: <primary-repo>/docs/business/overview.md>",
  type="business_overview",
)
```

Hand back to the orchestrator. The business tier is complete:
`business/overview.md`, `business/capabilities/*`, `business/domain-glossary.md`,
`business/journeys/*`, `business/rules/index.md`.
