## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Windows / locale resilience (#5317):** swept the codebase for control flow
  that branched on a *localized* OS command output / error string — the bug
  class behind the Spanish-Windows `schtasks` install failure — and migrated the
  genuine occurrences to locale-invariant signals (process exit codes, on-disk
  unit-file checks, and typed `syscall.Errno` values). Migrated: the watcher
  `Unload()` for schtasks / systemctl / launchctl (`internal/install/watchers/`,
  which had the same English-text match as the original bug), the daemon
  launchd `Load()`/`Unload()` (`internal/daemon/service/launchd_darwin.go`), and
  the selftest Windows "file in use" detector (`cmd/grafel/selftest.go`, now
  errno-based). The daemon `schtasks` `Unload()` keeps its English match only as
  a documented best-effort race fallback behind the exit-code `IsLoaded()` check
  (Refs [#5317](https://github.com/cajasmota/grafel/issues/5317),
  [#856](https://github.com/cajasmota/grafel/issues/856)).
- Dashboard Paths → "Downstream flow" modal now defaults to and only shows the
  **Tree** view; the **Flowchart** view is hidden behind a `SHOW_FLOWCHART` flag
  pending a layout fix (it currently renders disconnected EXIT/ENTRY/RETURN
  fragments). The flowchart renderer is retained, just gated
  ([#5324](https://github.com/cajasmota/grafel/issues/5324)).

### Added

- **CI lint gate `lint-localematch` (#5317):** a standard-library Go AST analyzer
  (`cmd/lint-localematch`) that fails CI when new code matches command
  output/error text for control flow — `strings.Contains/HasPrefix/HasSuffix/
  Index/EqualFold` or `regexp.MatchString` whose subject is data-flow-derived
  from an `exec.Command(...).Output()/CombinedOutput()/Run()` result or an
  `err.Error()` in an exec-using file. Scoped to files that shell out (low false
  positives); justified race fallbacks opt out with `// nolint:localematch`.
  Wired into `make lint`, `pre-merge.yml`, and `test.yml`
  (Refs [#5317](https://github.com/cajasmota/grafel/issues/5317)).

### Fixed

- **Dashboard wizard indexing froze mid-extraction and never showed completion;
  rebuild appeared to idle-wait ~5 min** ([#5326](https://github.com/cajasmota/grafel/issues/5326)).
  Three independent defects on the rebuild/progress path:
  - **Progress (UI freeze):** the indexer emits its terminal `done`/`error`
    progress event exactly once, but the broker's fan-out is best-effort
    (drop-on-full) — under load that single event could be dropped, leaving the
    wizard SSE stream sending only heartbeats and the UI frozen on the last
    mid-extraction frame. The broker now **retains the last terminal event per
    group** and the `/api/index-progress/{group}` SSE handler replays it on
    connect and re-asserts it on each heartbeat, so the terminal state is
    **always** rendered (then `close`), even if the live event was dropped or
    the client connected late.
  - **Goroutine leak (the "~5 min wait"):** the Rebuild RPC's dead-man heartbeat
    ran `for range ticker.C` with no exit path — `time.Ticker.Stop()` does not
    close the channel, so the goroutine blocked forever, leaking one goroutine
    per Rebuild RPC. The ticker goroutine is now torn down via a stop channel
    when the result lands. (The result itself was already delivered promptly via
    a buffered channel; the "5m0s" log line was the dead-man heartbeat, not a
    timeout the result waited on.)
  - **Diagnosability:** when the stall detector fires it now logs a bounded
    (≤1 MiB), once-per-RPC full goroutine dump (`runtime.Stack(_, true)`) so the
    next stall is root-causable from the daemon log alone. The warning interval
    is overridable via `GRAFEL_STALL_WARN_INTERVAL`.
- `grafel_find_callers` / `find_callees` / `neighbors` now resolve an entity by
  name or qualified name (not only the opaque entity_id), returning
  disambiguation candidates when ambiguous instead of a hard `entity not found`
  — fixes a ~35% error rate on name-based calls
  ([#5314](https://github.com/cajasmota/grafel/issues/5314)).
- **Windows (end-to-end, from user feedback):** the MCP bridge now dials the
  daemon via `transport.Dial`, selecting the named pipe on Windows (was a
  hardcoded AF_UNIX `net.Dial("unix", ...)`), so `/mcp` can connect; the offline
  stub also always carries a valid `inputSchema` so a connection failure surfaces
  clearly instead of as a cryptic Zod rejection (Refs [#856](https://github.com/cajasmota/grafel/issues/856)).
- **Windows (end-to-end, from user feedback):** `grafel install` no longer aborts
  on a clean install — `schtasks` Unload now checks existence via the exit-code
  based `IsLoaded()` instead of matching English-only error text (worked around a
  localized "cannot find the file" on non-English Windows) (Refs [#856](https://github.com/cajasmota/grafel/issues/856)).
- **Windows (end-to-end, from user feedback):** the task user SID is now resolved
  via the native `os/user` API instead of shelling out to `whoami /user`, which a
  PATH-shadowing MSYS/Git Bash `whoami` could break; an empty SID degrades to a
  conditional (omitted) `<UserId>` instead of invalid task XML (Refs [#856](https://github.com/cajasmota/grafel/issues/856)).
- **Windows (end-to-end, from user feedback):** the watcher PID registry now
  creates its state directory before taking the lock, fixing a non-fatal
  "system cannot find the path specified" on a fresh `%AppData%\grafel`
  (Refs [#856](https://github.com/cajasmota/grafel/issues/856)).
- **Windows (end-to-end, from user feedback):** cross-repo link passes now fall
  back to copying `graph.json`/`graph.fb` into the staging dir when `os.Symlink`
  fails for lack of `SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege`, so cross-repo edges are no
  longer silently 0 without Developer Mode/admin (Refs [#856](https://github.com/cajasmota/grafel/issues/856)).

### Added

- **Windows CMD installer + manual install path.** A new `install.bat` provides
  a non-PowerShell, non-admin one-line install for `cmd.exe`
  (`curl -fL …/install.bat -o "%TEMP%\grafel-install.bat" && "%TEMP%\grafel-install.bat"`);
  it mirrors `install.ps1` exactly (same `%USERPROFILE%\.grafel\bin` prefix,
  release asset names, `checksums.txt` SHA256 verification, and user-PATH append)
  using only Windows 10 1803+ built-ins. New `docs/install-windows-manual.md`
  documents a step-by-step locked-down/air-gapped install, and the install docs
  (README, `docs/install.md`, `docs/quickstart.md`) now present all three Windows
  methods — PowerShell, CMD, and manual
  (Fixes [#5319](https://github.com/cajasmota/grafel/issues/5319), Refs
  [#5318](https://github.com/cajasmota/grafel/issues/5318),
  [#856](https://github.com/cajasmota/grafel/issues/856)).

## [0.1.1] — 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- **Reindex is now resource-safe by default** ([#PR](https://github.com/cajasmota/grafel/pull/5310)) —
  background reindexing no longer saturates the host on a fresh `curl|bash`
  install. Previously the good behaviour was env-var-gated, so a clean install
  ran the indexer in-process at full host cores with no per-job CPU bound,
  spiking to 300–998% CPU for 10–20 min per `git push` (reported by a
  dogfooding user on a 36k-entity NestJS repo). Now, out of the box and with no
  env vars set:
  - **Subprocess indexer is default-on**, so each reindex runs in a short-lived
    child process bounded to `GRAFEL_EXTRACT_GOMAXPROCS` (default 2) cores —
    the host stays usable during heavy reindexing.
  - **The daemon's own in-process Go parallelism is capped at ~half the host
    cores** (`GRAFEL_DAEMON_GOMAXPROCS` default), bounding GC / algorithm
    passes / the in-process index fallback.
  - **Incremental reindex is default-on** (already shipped in #5231) so a
    single-file push patches the graph (~25× faster) instead of a full
    reindex.
  - **A Go soft memory limit is applied by default** (already shipped in
    #5237: ~40% of RAM, floor 2 GB, ceiling 2.5 GB) so swap can't saturate.

  All four remain overridable: the env vars are now **opt-OUT / tuning**
  overrides rather than enablers, so the existing production plist
  (`GRAFEL_SUBPROCESS_INDEXER=1`, `GRAFEL_INCREMENTAL_REINDEX=1`,
  `GRAFEL_DAEMON_MEMLIMIT_MB=1536`) is fully back-compatible.

### Added

- **`grafel_stats` exposes live reindex state** ([#PR](https://github.com/cajasmota/grafel/pull/5310)) —
  the tool now returns `is_indexing` (and, while indexing, `indexing_in_flight`
  + `indexing_started_at`) so a coordinator can query reindex state via MCP
  instead of polling `ps aux` for hot grafel processes.

---

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-23 (Preview Release)

grafel's first pre-release. Active development; APIs, MCP tool names,
and graph schema may change between minor versions.

### Added

- **5-tier docgen ladder** — Tier 0 single-section (#1809), Tier 1
  single-page with contracts (#1812), Tier 2 5-page slice with cross-page
  contracts (#1814), Tier 3 single-repo with repo-level contracts (#1817),
  Tier 4 full multi-repo group (#1820).

  `--llm-mode=emit` for Tier 0+1 (#1819), `--llm-mode=apply` (#1821),
  section cache (#1823), `generate-docs` skill Pass 20 orchestrator (#1822),
  user-facing docs (#1824).
- **MCP handshake cwd-gate** with `grafel_status` sentinel — tools list
  goes from 2,319 tokens → ~80 bytes for sessions outside any indexed group
  (#1769, #1783).
- **`grafel_stats --breakdown=unresolved_imports`** for import taxonomy
  (#1839).
- **Windows CGO experimental build workflow** (#1791) — produces
  `grafel.exe` artifact via MinGW on GitHub Actions.
- **Python `config_module` entity** for `settings.py`/`urls.py`/etc. (#1778).
- **Go extractor** — method-value references (#1789, #1792), intra-package
  bare-function calls (#1806, #1810), struct field references via receiver
  type chain (#1840, #1843).
- **Resolver** — platform-variant merging for `_unix.go` + `_windows.go`
  pairs (#1815).
- **`grafel_whoami` `wire_version` field** — returns `"0.1.0"`; bump per
  minor release (#1845).

### Changed

- **MCP param renames with compat aliases** — `grafel_find(query=)` was
  `question`; `grafel_get_source(entity_id=)` was `node_id` (#1790).
- **`grafel_stats.fidelity` scope narrowed to IMPORTS-only** matching
  `health-history.bug_rate` — value jumped from 0.656 to 0.943 on grafel
  (prior dilution was hiding ~5,000 import rescues) (#1842, #1844).
- **MCP positioning** embedded in handshake/CLAUDE.md/skills/docs: "pair MCP
  + grep" is the canonical position (#1838).
- **Default response limits shrunk**; token_budget enforcement extended;
  per-tool field elision (#1738, #1739, #1749, #1751).
- **`grafel_find` returns TOON format** with `id` as first column (#1737,
  #1743, #1761).
- **Entity-ID interning** in MCP responses (#1740, #1750).
- **Subgraph fold** — `get_subgraph` + `summarize_subgraph` →
  `grafel_subgraph(format=raw|markdown)` (#1754, #1764, #1768).
- Posix-only test files now carry `//go:build !windows` tags for Windows
  compatibility (#1787, #1804).

### Fixed

- **`grafel_get_source` 5 s fsevents wedge on macOS** — now 48 ms via
  `O_NONBLOCK` + `lstat` + semaphore (#1773, #1780).
- **`gitignore.go` Windows build** via `_unix`/`_windows` split (#1787).
- **`filepathBase` cross-platform path handling** (#1782).
- **Tier 4 LLM emit propagation** through Tier 2/3/4 opts + integration test
  (#1825, #1828, #1832).
- **Section guidance `graph_context`** now populated with
  `qualified_name`/`repo`/`source_window` (#1827, #1831).
- **MSYS2 path resolution** on Windows GHA runners (#1805, #1808).
- **grafel daemon test deadline** 2 s → 4 s + `test.yml` `-timeout 5m`
  (#1797, #1800).
- **`mat: zero length` panic guard** in `RunAlgorithmsWithOptions` (#1795,
  #1801).
- **`TestAxumE2E` skip-on-CI guard** (#1798, #1799).
- **166-file gofmt baseline** restored (#1786).
- **Vendored go-tree-sitter** with `//go:build cgo` patch (#1796, #1802).

### Known Limitations (roadmap for v0.2.0+)

- Resolver platform-variant merging works in unit tests but does not fully
  reflect in `find_callers` end-to-end (#1818 — separate bug class).
- Token-ratio recovery: iter6 had token ratio 6.83× vs 0.7× target — quality
  is strong, token economy needs work (#1807).
- Docgen `source_window` cwd-relative path bug — affects `BuildBundle` when
  called from a cwd outside the indexed repo root (#1834).
- Tier 4 emit one-off bundle/page count mismatch: one page in N produces no
  bundle (#1835).
- Go struct field extraction v2: cross-file struct types, interfaces,
  generics, embedded type promotion (#1840 — current v1 handles same-file
  struct fields only).
- `grafel_stats.fidelity` is IMPORTS-only; CALLS and REFERENCES
  improvements are not yet surfaced as metrics.
- JS/TS/Python sibling sweeps for the receiver-chain pattern that #1843 fixed
  in Go are queued for v0.2.0.
