#
# VERIFY-2 EXTENDED corpus harness (Refs #44, #87, #96).
#
# This is the TIER-2 / extended-coverage sibling of scripts/verify2/run.sh.
# It re-runs the 168 corpus entries that the 2026-05-19 curation moved out
# of the per-change ship-gate. Use it pre-release or on a weekly cron — the
# primary scripts/verify2/run.sh ship-gate corpus is the fast 114-entry
# tier-1 set and is the one that gates every change.
#
# Why two tiers:
#   - Most dropped entries are intra-family redundancies (e.g. 8 state-mgmt
#     libs, 12 web-framework alternates per language, 5 CDK flavors). They
#     do not exercise new extractor code paths; running them every change
#     burned wall-clock without changing the bug-rate signal.
#   - But they DO catch framework-specific annotation surfaces (Quarkus
#     `@QuarkusTest`, NgRx dispatchers, Liquibase changelog XML, etc.) so
#     we keep them around for pre-release safety.
#
# See docs/verify2/corpus-curation-2026-05-19.md for the full per-entry
# decision log. Hard rule: this script reuses the run.sh harness verbatim
# except for the REPOS array.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/verify2/run-extended.sh [--runs N]
#
# Flag:
#   --runs N   Index each repo N times and report median bug_rate + min/max
#              range (Refs #482).  Default: 5.  N=1 = single-shot.
#
# Env vars: same as run.sh (GRAFEL_CORPORA_DIR, GRAFEL_BIN,
# GRAFEL_VERIFY2_TIMEOUT, GRAFEL_VERBOSE, GRAFEL_VERIFY2_RUNS).

  # Node (Fastify/Koa/Hapi/Sails/AdonisJS), Python (Tornado/Starlette/
  # Pyramid/Bottle), PHP (Slim/CodeIgniter/Yii), Ruby (Sinatra/Hanami/
  # Grape), Rust (Axum/Rocket/Warp/Tide), Scala (Akka HTTP/http4s),
  # Clojure (Compojure/Pedestal), Elixir (Plug/Phoenix LiveView), and
  # Kotlin (Javalin/http4k). Each entry pinned to the SHA recorded in
  # the umbrella body and verified via git ls-remote --symref on
  # 2026-05-10. Sparse paths are not used for these entries — the
  # repos are sample apps or single-framework sources at HEAD size.
