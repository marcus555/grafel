#
# VERIFY-2 quality channel (Refs #607, #482) — extraction-quality gate.
#
# Thin wrapper that delegates to scripts/quality/run.sh and surfaces the
# per-fixture JSON reports as a CI artifact. Designed to run as a separate
# CI step (see .github/workflows/quality.yml) so quality failures are
# reported independently from the bug-rate harness.
#
# A PR that regresses any must-have entity / relationship, or introduces a
# forbidden-relationship hit, will cause this script to exit 2 with a clear
# per-fixture miss report on stderr.
#
# New fixtures are picked up automatically: scripts/quality/run.sh iterates
# over internal/quality/golden/*/ — no explicit registration required.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/verify2/run-quality.sh [--runs N]
#
# Env vars:
#   GRAFEL_BIN   path to grafel binary (default: auto-built)
#   QUALITY_OUT_DIR  directory to write per-fixture JSON reports into
#                    (default: reports/quality)
#   QUALITY_RUNS     number of runs per fixture for median measurement
#                    (default: 5; overridden by --runs flag if both are set,
#                    the flag wins)
