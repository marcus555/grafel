# VERIFY-2 — bug-rate / resolution-rate harness

This directory hosts the `grafel` indexer regression harness used to
measure the **bug-rate** and **resolution-rate** required by the v1.0
ship gate (Refs issue #58).

## What it measures

For each indexed repository, `grafel index --json-stats` emits a
per-disposition tally for every relationship endpoint the resolver
inspected:

| disposition | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `resolved` | stub rewritten to a 16-char entity ID — fully resolved |
| `external-known` | endpoint points at `ext:<pkg>` and `<pkg>` is on the static allowlist |
| `external-unknown` | endpoint points at `ext:<pkg>` but `<pkg>` is NOT on the allowlist |
| `dynamic` | reflective / dynamic-dispatch idiom; static resolution is impossible by design |
| `bug-extractor` | a stub references a Name with 0 emitted entities — extractor missed an emit |
| `bug-resolver`  | the Name exists in the graph, but the resolver couldn't disambiguate |
| `unclassified` | catch-all; any non-zero value warrants investigation |

The aggregate metrics:

- `bug_rate = (bug-extractor + bug-resolver) / total_endpoints`
- `resolution_rate = resolved / total_endpoints`

Ship-gate target (issue #44): **`bug_rate <= 1%`** across the full
extractor matrix.

## Filesystem layout

The harness writes **outside** the grafel repo — corpora and reports
are large and not appropriate for git tracking.

- Corpus clones: `$GRAFEL_CORPORA_DIR/<repo-name>/`
- Reports: `$GRAFEL_CORPORA_DIR/_reports/<ISO-timestamp>.md`
- Built binary (cached): `$GRAFEL_CORPORA_DIR/_bin/grafel`

`GRAFEL_CORPORA_DIR` defaults to
`$HOME/Documents/Projects/grafel-corpora`.

## How to run

```bash
# Default — clones every configured repo and writes a fresh report.
scripts/verify2/run.sh

# Override the corpora dir.
GRAFEL_CORPORA_DIR=/tmp/ag-corp scripts/verify2/run.sh

# Forward verbose indexer logs.
GRAFEL_VERBOSE=1 scripts/verify2/run.sh

# Reuse a pre-built binary (skip the in-script `go build`).
GRAFEL_BIN=/usr/local/bin/grafel scripts/verify2/run.sh
```

The script prints the full report path on stdout when it completes.

## How to compare two reports

```bash
scripts/verify2/compare.sh \
  ~/Documents/Projects/grafel-corpora/_reports/2026-04-01T00-00-00Z.md \
  ~/Documents/Projects/grafel-corpora/_reports/2026-05-09T00-00-00Z.md
```

The output shows per-repo entity/relationship deltas plus the change in
`bug_rate` and `resolution_rate` (both as percentage-point deltas).

## Corpus coverage (Refs #87, #96)

The corpus targets the full extractor matrix — 32 languages plus
representative frameworks, ORMs, manifests, and tools. To make
regressions diagnosable, the corpus is also diversified across stack
characteristics.

**Policy (Refs #96):** the corpus prefers *sample applications that USE
a framework* over the framework's own source tree. We measure how the
indexer handles framework-using user code, not how it handles framework
internals. Library-source entries are kept only when they are small
enough to also stand in as canonical user code (e.g. `requests`,
`click`, `sidekiq`, `gin`, `chi`, `exposed`).

The Swift and C# slots previously pointed at framework internals
(`vapor/vapor` `Sources/Vapor`, `dotnet/aspnetcore` `src/Mvc/Mvc.Core`).
Both were replaced with sample apps to align with the policy:
`vapor-api-template` (`vapor/api-template`, the canonical Vapor starter
with Controllers/Routes/Migrations) and `aspnetcore-realworld`
(`gothinkster/aspnetcore-realworld-example-app`, an ASP.NET Core MVC +
EF Core RealWorld implementation).

| characteristic | repos in corpus |
| --- | --- |
| ORM-heavy | `django-realworld`, `rails-realworld`, `aspnetcore-realworld` |
| HTTP routing | `gin`, `chi`, `express-realworld`, `actix-examples`, `vapor-api-template`, `laravel-quickstart`, `symfony-demo` |
| microservice / RPC / messaging | `etcd`, `kafka-streams-examples` |
| CLI tool | `click` |
| config-heavy / framework | `spring-petclinic`, `pandas` (core), `nestjs-starter`, `nextjs-commerce` |
| async runtime / concurrency | `mini-redis`, `ktor-samples` |

Add new repos to grow the matrix — coverage gaps surface immediately as
empty per-language rows in the aggregate report.

## How to add a new corpus repo

Edit the `REPOS` array near the top of `run.sh`. Each entry is a
pipe-separated tuple:

```
<name>|<git-url>|<ref>|<primary-language>[|<sparse-path>]
```

The fifth field is **optional**. When present, the cloner switches to a
blob-less partial clone (`git clone --filter=blob:none --no-checkout`)
plus cone-mode sparse checkout (`git sparse-checkout set <sparse-path>`)
so we only materialise that sub-tree on disk. Use it for any repo whose
full HEAD checkout exceeds **~200 MB**.

```bash
REPOS=(
  # Plain (small) clone:
  "myrepo|https://github.com/owner/repo.git|main|typescript"

  # Sparse checkout (monorepo):
  "myrepo-core|https://github.com/owner/big-monorepo.git|main|java|modules/core"
)
```

### Size guidance

Estimate the HEAD clone size **before** adding a repo. Rough rules of
thumb:

| range | action |
| --- | --- |
| < 50 MB | full clone is fine |
| 50–200 MB | full clone acceptable; consider a subtree if a small focused module exists |
| > 200 MB | **required** to use the sparse-path field — pick the smallest module that exercises the language/framework you care about |
| > 1 GB | sparse-path is mandatory; pick a single package directory and document the choice in a `# comment` next to the entry |

A quick estimate from the GitHub UI: open the repo, hit `t` to enter the
file finder — the badge at the top shows total file count. Multiply the
average source-file size (~5–20 KB) for a rough working-tree number.

### Per-repo wall-clock cap

Large repos can keep the indexer running for a long time. The harness
caps each repo at `GRAFEL_VERIFY2_TIMEOUT` seconds (default
**600s = 10 min**) using `gtimeout` (coreutils) when available, falling
back to `timeout`. Set `GRAFEL_VERIFY2_TIMEOUT=0` to disable the cap.
A timed-out repo is recorded as `ERROR` in the per-repo table and does
not abort the rest of the run.

**Constraint:** only public OSS repositories. Private code, vendored
client trees, and internal codenames must never appear here — the
harness output is shared and tracked.

## How to interpret a report

Each report has the following sections (Refs #88):

1. **Per-repo results** — one row per indexed repo with
   files / entities / relationships / `bug_rate` / `resolution_rate`,
   followed by an **aggregate row** (`AGGREGATE`) summing across all
   repos at the bottom of the table.
2. **Per-repo disposition breakdown** — one sub-section per repo with a
   `| disposition | count | pct |` table covering `resolved`,
   `external-known`, `external-unknown`, `dynamic`, `bug-extractor`,
   `bug-resolver`, `unclassified`.
3. **Aggregate** — corpus-wide totals plus the global `bug_rate` and
   `resolution_rate`.
4. **Aggregate disposition breakdown** — combined endpoint counts +
   percentages across the entire corpus.
5. **Per-language aggregate** — repos grouped by primary language (set
   in the `REPOS` manifest in `run.sh`) with summed file / entity /
   relationship / endpoint counts plus per-language `bug_rate` and
   `resolution_rate`.
6. **Ship-gate check** — `PASS` when aggregate `bug_rate <= 1%`,
   otherwise `FAIL`.

If the corpus is empty (no clones present, or every clone indexed 0
files) `run.sh` exits with status 1 and writes nothing — empty reports
are never produced.

When `bug_rate` regresses, the `bug-extractor` and `bug-resolver`
buckets in the breakdown identify which side of the resolver split the
new failures landed in. Pair the report with `GRAFEL_VERBOSE=1` on a
single repo to print sample stub strings for those buckets — they point
directly at the missing extraction or the ambiguous-resolution case.

The `compare.sh` helper diffs two reports across per-repo metrics,
aggregate metrics, **and** per-disposition counts so disposition drift
between runs is visible at a glance.
