# ADR-003: SCOPE entity taxonomy as the data model

## Context

A code knowledge graph that wants to answer questions like "which queue does this lambda consume?" or "what controllers route to this view?" needs a node vocabulary rich enough to distinguish three layers:

1. **Runtime concepts** — functions, classes, modules, variables; the things a language parser produces.
2. **Framework concepts** — controllers, routes, queues, lambdas, hooks, JSX components, viewsets; concepts that exist as patterns within frameworks (Django, Rails, Express, Next.js, NestJS, FastAPI, etc.) but are not first-class in the host language's AST.
3. **Infrastructure concepts** — deployed resources defined by IaC (queues, topics, tables, buckets, deployments) that bridge to runtime concepts via configuration.

A flat node typology with a single string `type` field collapses these layers, loses framework semantics, and forces every query to special-case identifier patterns. Per-language ad-hoc types fragment further, since a "controller" looks different across stacks but is the same conceptual node for the agent's purposes.

We need a single, namespaced typology that all extractors emit into and that all queries can rely on. The typology must be stable enough to commit to in v1.0 but small enough to fit in agent context.

## Decision

grafel adopts the SCOPE entity-kind hierarchy as its canonical node taxonomy. Internal node types are namespaced under `SCOPE.*`:

- **Code structure**: `SCOPE.Operation`, `SCOPE.Component`, `SCOPE.Schema`, `SCOPE.Variable`, `SCOPE.Reference`
- **Behavioral patterns**: `SCOPE.Pattern`, `SCOPE.Evolution`
- **Web / framework**: `SCOPE.Endpoint`, `SCOPE.Route`, `SCOPE.Service`, `SCOPE.View`, `SCOPE.UIComponent`, `SCOPE.JSX`, `SCOPE.Stylesheet`
- **Async / data**: `SCOPE.Queue`, `SCOPE.Event`, `SCOPE.Datastore`, `SCOPE.DataAccess`, `SCOPE.ExternalAPI`
- **Infrastructure**: `SCOPE.InfraResource`

Edges use a closed enum of relationship kinds: `CALLS`, `IMPORTS`, `DEPENDS_ON`, `IMPLEMENTS`, `EXTENDS`, `USES_HOOK`, `ROUTES_TO`, `CONSUMES_QUEUE`, `TRIGGERS_LAMBDA`, `READS_TABLE`, `WRITES_TABLE`, plus a small set of additional relations documented in `SCHEMA.md`.

The MCP rendering layer **strips** the `SCOPE.` prefix when surfacing entities to the agent: agents see `Operation`, `Component`, `Endpoint` etc., not `SCOPE.Operation`. The internal storage and on-disk JSON keep the namespaced form so the typology remains explicit in the data model and so future namespaces (e.g., `META.*`) can coexist without collision.

## Consequences

### Positive
- One vocabulary across all languages and frameworks; queries do not branch on stack.
- Framework semantics are preserved: a Django viewset and an Express controller both become `SCOPE.Component` with framework-specific tags, queryable uniformly.
- The infrastructure layer participates as a peer rather than as an afterthought, enabling cross-layer questions (which lambda consumes which queue).
- Stripping the prefix at the MCP boundary keeps agent context short and human-readable.

### Negative
- Extractors must agree on where each language construct lands (e.g., a Rust trait → `SCOPE.Schema`? `SCOPE.Pattern`?). The mapping decisions are documented per-language in `EXTRACTORS.md`.
- The closed relationship enum requires schema-versioning discipline; adding a new edge kind is a breaking change for downstream consumers.
- Agents calling the MCP and authors reading the on-disk JSON see slightly different vocabularies (prefix vs no prefix); the rendering rule must be documented.

### Neutral
- The taxonomy is opinionated; teams with very different mental models may want to remap, which is supported via configuration but not encouraged.

## Alternatives considered

- **Ad-hoc per-language types** — rejected: forces every consumer to learn N typologies and special-case every query.
- **Single-string `type` field with free-form values** — rejected: loses framework semantics, makes filtering brittle, and prevents schema validation.
- **Reuse an external ontology (e.g., UML, schema.org)** — rejected: external ontologies do not cleanly express runtime/framework/infra distinctions in code.
- **Two separate graphs (code vs infra) joined at query time** — rejected: doubles the storage model and complicates queries that span layers; see ADR-006 for the single in-memory graph decision.
