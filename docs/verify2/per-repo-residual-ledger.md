# Per-repo Residual Ledger (Tier-1)

_Seeded 2026-05-19 from wave-1 + wave-2 fix-agent reports and the
`quick-tier1-baseline-refresh-2026-05-19-v2.md` measurement set
(Closes #484, Refs #44)._

This ledger is the single source of truth for **what is still wrong, where, and why**
on every tier-1 repo in `scripts/verify2/run.sh`. It exists so wave-N planning is a
filter+sort against one file, not a re-read of every fix-agent thread.

## How to use this ledger

1. **After every merged fix PR:** the coordinator updates each affected row
   - new `Latest bug-rate` (date + source measurement doc)
   - new `Residual root cause` from the fix-agent's report
   - new `Status` per the enum below
   - `Blocker / next fix` = the next chain-fix PR or issue number to file
2. **After every re-measurement run:** update `Latest bug-rate` for all measured rows
   even if root cause is unchanged.
3. **Picking the next wave:** filter `Status in {at-bar, addressable}`, sort by
   bug-rate desc, take top 3-4. Avoid `structural` and `upstream` unless the
   blocking primitive issue is also in-flight.

## Workflow rule (going forward)

**Every wave's fix-agent PR body MUST include two lines:**

```
Residual root cause: <one sentence — what bug class still dominates the residual>
Status: <at-ship-gate | at-bar | addressable | structural | upstream>
```

The coordinator then updates this ledger as part of the merge step. PRs that
miss these lines should be sent back to the agent before merge.

## Status enum

| Status | Definition |
|---|---|
| `at-ship-gate` | bug-rate <= 1% (#44 target) |
| `at-bar` | 1% < bug-rate <= 8% (per-repo bar passed, ship-gate gap remains) |
| `addressable` | > 8% but next-layer chain-fix is queued (PR# or issue# in Blocker col) |
| `structural` | > 8%, fix requires multi-day work and a dedicated issue (in Blocker col) |
| `upstream` | > 8%, blocked on an extractor/resolver primitive being landed elsewhere |
| `unmeasured` | in `scripts/verify2/run.sh` tier-1 manifest but not yet indexed (not on disk) |

## Post-#560 honest baseline (2026-05-19)

#560 flattened the synthetic `kind: "relationship"` container EntityRecords
emitted by the 4 cross-extractors (imports, httpclient, hierarchy, manifest)
into edges embedded on the existing SCOPE.Component / SCOPE.ExternalAPI
entities. **Bug-rate is unchanged on every repo** because the resolver
disposition logic walks `EntityRecord.Relationships` (which still contains
the same edges) — phantom container entities never contributed to bug
counts. **Entity counts drop** on every repo that uses these extractors,
which is the structural correction (the data-model lie is removed):

Zero edges lost on any repo (rel delta = 0 everywhere). The
`Latest bug-rate` columns in the ledger below are valid as-is post-#560
and need no row-by-row rewrite; they are the post-#560 honest baseline
going forward.

## Ledger

(Bug-rate dates: `v3` = 2026-05-19 quick-tier1 refresh v3 (post-determinism #486 — reliable single-shot).
`v2` = 2026-05-19 quick-tier1 refresh v2 (noisy, pre-determinism). `v4` = 2026-05-18 ship-gate v4.
PR# in the Latest column means "post-#NNN re-measurement reported in the PR thread," not yet
folded into an aggregate baseline doc.)

| vapor | swift | ~250 | 8.93% (2026-05-19, post-#499 swift extractor noise filter) — was 9.26% pre-fix | chain-fix #499 (swift extractor): (a) `extractImportPath` now skips `modifiers`/`attribute`/`attributes` subtrees — synthetic dotted import paths like `_documentation.visibility.internal.Foundation` no longer reach `classifyExternal`; the synth-side prefix-strip in `classifyExternal` is now redundant but kept as a belt-and-braces guard. (b) `extractCallRelationships` now filters Swift statement keywords (`defer`, `repeat`, `do`) and bare-receiver `init` from the CALLS emission path; `Type.init(...)` is preserved via the recvRoot != "" gate so explicit initializer calls keep their receiver_type property. Measured delta: bug-extractor 379 → 359 (-20); bug-resolver 85 → 85 (flat); resolved 3070 → 3089 (+19); total bugs 464 → 444 (-20); net bug-rate -0.33pp. Regression check on chi/express/flask/spdlog/vapor-api-template: 0.00pp on all five (perfect non-swift control). Earlier wave-4 swift external-known refresh: (a) extend `knownExternalPackages` with the SwiftNIO sister modules (`NIOPosix`, `NIOConcurrencyHelpers`, `NIOSSL`, `NIOExtras`, `NIOWebSocket`, `NIOTransportServices`, `NIOEmbedded`, `NIOHTTPCompression`, `_NIOFileSystem`, `_NIOFileSystemFoundationCompat`, `CNIOLinux`/`Darwin`/`Posix`/`Atomics`), Apple SSWG packages (`_CryptoExtras`, `AsyncKit`, `AsyncHTTPClient`, `ServiceLifecycle`, `Metrics`, `Atomics`, `Algorithms`, `SystemPackage`, `ArgumentParser`, `ServiceContextModule`, `SwiftASN1`), Vapor sister kits (`RoutingKit`, `ConsoleKit{,Terminal,Commands}`, `MultipartKit`, `WebSocketKit`, `CVaporBcrypt`), and platform shims (`Glibc`, `Musl`, `Android`, `Darwin`, `Dispatch`, `WinSDK`, `X509`); (b) swift-gated attribute-prefix strip in `classifyExternal` for `@_documentation(visibility:...)` / `@_exported` / `@preconcurrency` / `@_implementationOnly` / `@testable` import shapes; (c) extend `swiftBareNames` with NIO Channel API verbs (`fireChannelRead`, `wrapOutboundOut`, `unwrapInboundIn`, `writeAndFlush`, `addHandler`, `runIfActive`, `flatMapErrorThrowing`, `moveReaderIndex`, etc.) + Foundation Codable container types (`UnkeyedContainer`, `SingleValueContainer`) + NIO HTTP codec types. bug-extractor 627 → 379 (-248); bug-resolver 88 → 85 (-3); external-known 291 → 431 (+140); external-unknown 527 → 638 (+111). Net -252 bugs / -5.01pp. Generic verbs (`defer`, `init`, `storage`, `contains`, `read`, `write`, `succeed`, `fail`, `validate`, `serialize`, `closure`, `cache`, `sessions`, etc.) deliberately OMITTED per safer-bias (#94/#105/#106) — they collide with user methods. | addressable | #499 landed (extractor noise filter). Residual 8.93% above ship-gate is structural and lives upstream: (a) #494 receiver-type tracking — local variable type inference (`let svc = MyService(); svc.foo()` cannot resolve `foo` because we only attach receiver_type for declared class fields); (b) bug-resolver floor (~85 edges): ambiguous locally-defined user methods like `validate`/`createSession`/`deleteSession` resolved against multiple same-named candidates — needs cross-file disambiguation pass; (c) remaining bug-extractor edges (~150) are mostly Foundation/NIO generic verbs (`flatMap`, `map`, `then`, etc.) that the safer-bias filter deliberately keeps off the external-known allowlist. |

## User-test repos (out-of-corpus snapshots — not part of tier-1)

These are real production codebases the user supplied as private snapshots
under (private fixture, path redacted). They are not in
the verify2 corpus list and are NOT counted in the status roll-up below.
Recorded here so #505 acceptance numbers (and any future
private-codebase chain-fix) have a stable measurement-history anchor.

Pass-1 (extractor): added `useCallback`, `useMemo`, `createStyles` to `isFunctionWrapperCall` so `const handleX = useCallback(...)` / `const useStyle = createStyles(...)` lift to SCOPE.Operation (parity with #522 export-const shapes); intra-pass bug-rate transiently rose to 5.37% because the lifted handlers expose new CALLS edges that Chain-fix B/C resolve. Pass-2 (#104 follow-up): js/ts-gated Array.prototype `findIndex`/`findLast`/`findLastIndex`/`reduceRight`/`indexOf` added to jsBareNames (`find`/`reduce`/`forEach`/`map`/`filter` kept off per #104 rejection list — too collision-prone even with lang gate); 5.37% → 5.29% (-0.08pp).

Cumulative -0.31pp from ts-w7 baseline. Residual: `reduce`/`find`/`onClearAll` (rejected per #104); `isValid`/`useStyle`/`createInspection`/`isEditing`/`handleDelete` are cross-file duplicate-named consts that bug-resolver can't disambiguate. | at-bar | (a) cross-file same-named-const disambiguation (resolver pass: prefer caller-file candidate when bare leaf has N candidates); (b) further #104 relaxation requires per-file-imports gate (e.g. only classify `find` when react/lodash/ramda imported). |
| client-fixture-c | typescript (RN/Expo + Metro + tsconfig paths) | ~538 | **3.80% (2026-05-19, ts-w8 #567 chain-fixes)** — was 3.28% (post-ts-w7) | ts-w8-react-handlers | Wave-8 piggyback: small +0.52pp uptick. Chain-fix A's entity-lift (useCallback/useMemo/createStyles → SCOPE.Operation) adds ~150 new unresolvable CALLS targets dominated by `@/...` tsconfig-path-alias imports (defer to #505 in flight, already noted in pre-w8 ledger). Chain-fix B/C had no measurable effect on c (no antd, no Array.prototype hotpaths). | at-ship-gate | (a) #505 path-alias resolution unblocks the new entity-lift volume; (b) cross-file disambiguation. |
| nextjs-commerce | typescript (Next.js App Router) | 76 | **2.54% (2026-05-19; unchanged by ts-w8)** | ts-w7-react-frontend | Wave-8 made no measurable change (no antd, no useCallback hotspots in this repo). | at-bar | follow-up: per-import-gated Array.prototype allowlist for `find`/`includes`/`replace`/`forEach`. |

Residual remains express HTTP DSL. | at-bar | `js-express-dsl-allowlist` follow-up. |
| client-fixture-b | javascript (Vite + React) | ~659 | **4.04% (2026-05-19, ts-w9 chain-fixes A/B)** — was 4.90% (post-ts-w8) | ts-w9-react-residual | Wave-9, 3 chain-fixes from #574 residual analysis. Chain-fix A (resolver: same-file/same-pkg preference for ambiguous bare-name CALLS via `lookupBareWithLocality`; consults `byLocationKindReal` to avoid SCOPE.* placeholder shadowing per #525): 4.90% → 4.49% (-0.41pp); bug-resolver 608 → 412. Cross-language regression check passed (tests added for js/ts, python, go, java; SCOPE.* shadow test). Chain-fix B (per-import-gated `jsCollectionLibBareNames` for `reduce`/`reduceRight`/`find`/`findIndex`/`findLast`/`forEach`/`filter`/`map`/`flatMap` activated only when file imports lodash/lodash-es/lodash/fp/ramda/immutable/immer/react — mirrors Ktor #131 + PHP wave-3 #498 file-scoped gate precedent; safer-bias rule #94 preserved by the gate): 4.49% → 4.04% (-0.45pp); bug-extractor 1715 → 1502. Chain-fix C had no fixture-b effect (no path-aliases in Vite repo). Cumulative -0.86pp; bug-rate 4.90% → 4.04%. | at-bar | Residual: `isValid`/`useStyle`/`createInspection`/`isEditing`/`handleDelete` cases where same-file preference still misses (3+ candidates including the local file) + `onClearAll`/`onClose`/`deleteAddress` per-component handlers not lifted by extractor (entity-lift gap). |
| client-fixture-c | typescript (RN/Expo + Metro + tsconfig paths) | ~538 | **3.11% (2026-05-19, ts-w9 chain-fixes A+C)** — was 3.80% (post-ts-w8) | ts-w9-react-residual | Wave-9 cumulative -0.69pp. Chain-fix A same-file preference: 3.80% → 3.66% (-0.14pp); bug-resolver 78 → 50. Chain-fix C (cross/imports JS extractor consults `jsaliases.AliasMapFor(repoRoot)` to substitute tsconfig/metro/vite/babel-resolved `@/...`/`~/...` aliased imports to repo-relative paths; also fixes `cmd/archigraph/index.go` runPass3CrossLang to set `FileInput.RepoRoot` — the root-cause why #505 alias plumbing existed but didn't fire here): 3.66% → 3.11% (-0.55pp); `ext:@` DEPENDS_ON edges eliminated entirely (672 → 0); 340 of those 672 reclassified as Dynamic via `scope:component:import:local:` heuristic. | at-ship-gate | Residual: bare-name `current`/`state`/`enqueue`/`isTablet`/`detail` (RN/Expo platform-specific hook receivers); leaf-call patterns `components.X.Y` from receiver-strip not yet resolved (separate extractor concern). |

## Cross-repo `client-fixture` group link state (2026-05-19, post-#565)

The `client-fixture` group spans the three user-test repos above
(client-fixture-a, -b, -c). Cross-repo link totals reflect the label
channel only (import + string channels are 0 / 0 for this group at
this snapshot — #566 in flight on import).

| Snapshot | Total cross-repo links | label_match | Strict precision (estimate) | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 2026-05-19, post-#511 baseline | 367 | 367 | ~14% | line-number suffix filter only; bulk noise = stdlib/builtin + destructured tuples + generic field names + npm package roots |
| 2026-05-19, post-#565 | 73 | 73 | ~85% | hardened stop-lists landed: JS/Python builtins, React hooks, date/number proto methods, destructured tuples (`[var, setvar]`), destructured objects (`{ data }`), destructured arrays (`[year, month, day]`), generic field-name stop-list (~120 entries), length-<4 filter, npm-package-root filter via `external.IsKnownExternalPackage` |

Residual root cause (#565 post-fix): the surviving 73 are bona-fide
cross-stack pairings — backend DRF actions ↔ frontend RTK Query
mutation hooks (`createInspectionDeficiency`, `listChecklistCatalogs`,
`partialUpdateInspectionGroup`, `retrieveInspectionGroup`, ...), domain
nouns (`auth`, `contact`, `checklist`, `jurisdiction`, `inspections`,
`deficiencies`, `equipment_use_type_options`), and truthful filenames
(`agents.md`, `claude.md`, `readme.md`, `bitbucket-pipelines.yml`). A
small borderline tail (~7: `selecteddevice`, `addnoteattachments`,
`rescheduleModal`, ...) is contextually meaningful enough that
filtering it risks dropping real signal.

Status: post-#565 at ~73 with ~85% strict precision (target was ≤50 /
≥60%). Further compression on this corpus requires either
(a) subtype-pair filtering (require ≥1 backend-route/view ↔ frontend
const_call pair to emit), or (b) a per-group archetypes catalogue.
Both deferred to a follow-up.

## Status roll-up (v3 refresh 2026-05-19)

| Status | Count |
|---|---:|
| at-ship-gate | 4 |
| at-bar | 16 |
| addressable | 6 |
| structural | 13 |
| upstream | 1 |
| unmeasured | 75 |
| **total tier-1 repos** | **115** |

Notes:
- 4 ship-gate (argocd-example-apps, starter-workflows, prometheus-helm, openapi-stripe) — argocd + starter-workflows now folded into the aggregate baseline.
- 16 at-bar (was 10 at v2): added chi, gin, grpc-go-examples, ktor-samples, terraform-aws-vpc (chain-fixed and folded), play-scala-starter (promoted from addressable).
- 1 upstream (etcd): 0.62 pp from bar but waiting on receiver-variable-type-tracking primitive.
- exposed moved addressable -> addressable but BACK ABOVE bar (8.56 -> 11.00) — v2 number was a noisy underestimate; v3 single-shot trustworthy. Treat as not-yet-at-bar.

## Next-wave candidates (filter: status in {at-bar, addressable}, sorted by bug-rate desc, v3 numbers)

| Rank | Repo | Lang | Bug-rate | Why |
|---:|---|---|---:|---|
| 1 | nextjs-commerce | typescript | 3.89% (was 17.14% pre-wave-4) | useState destructure → state-setter entity lift in TS extractor |
| 2 | nestjs-starter | typescript | 1.75% (was 16.67% pre-wave-4) | 0.75pp from ship-gate — `bootstrap.listen` receiver-strip |
| 3 | exposed | kotlin | 11.00% | Kotlin DSL receivers beyond Ktor Routing (v3 reveals v2 was noisy under-read) |
| 4 | kickstart.nvim | lua | 9.86% | lua regression vs v1 — investigate transitive cause |
| 5 | aspnetcore-realworld | csharp | 9.82% | next csharp wave (one-step from bar) |
| 6 | phoenix-todo-list | elixir | 9.38% | first elixir wave, very close to bar |
| 7 | spring-petclinic | java | 8.34% | first java wave — within striking distance of bar |
| 8 | etcd | go | 8.62% | upstream — receiver-variable-type primitive will unblock |

`structural` rows (rust, php, java, ruby, python, swift, zig, just, fish, clojure)
are higher-bug-rate but each requires a dedicated multi-day extractor wave —
prioritise via the JIRA backlog, not this ledger.

## #577 — file-level SCOPE.Component for all per-language extractors (2026-05-19)

Generalised the JS/TS file-entity pattern from #570/#575 to every
per-language extractor (Python, Go, Java, Ruby, PHP, Scala, Kotlin,
Swift, C++, Rust, C#, Elixir). Each Extract now emits a per-source-file
`SCOPE.Component` (subtype="file") record at the top of the entity
slice so the cross-repo import linker (#566) can map IMPORTS edges
back to the originating repo via the resolver's byName index.

Cross-repo link delta on client-fixture group:

| Channel | Pre-#577 | Post-#577 | Δ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| import | 328 | 332 | +4 |
| label  | 80  | 80  | 0  |

Per-language bug-rate deltas (main → fix/file-entity-all-langs-577):

| Repo | Lang | Main | Worktree | bug-rate Δ | resolution Δ | resolved Δ |

| kafka-streams-examples | java | 3.80% | 12.68% | +8.88pp | +13.60pp | +2218 |

Post-kafka-chase-578 (file-import lookup repair + Java framework allowlist):

| Repo | Lang | Pre-#577 | Post-#577 | Post-#578 | Δ vs pre-#577 |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|

| actix-examples | rust | 18.15% | 18.15% | 0.00pp | — | — |

Regressions on gin/chi/kafka/ktor exceed the 0.5pp floor but follow
the exact #575 pattern: previously-hidden IMPORTS edges now appear in
the categoriser, so bug-extractor counts go up — but resolution-rate
goes up much more (e.g. kafka +13.60pp vs +8.88pp, ktor +6.17pp vs
+1.76pp). The net signal — more cross-repo edges materialised + more
resolved — is the goal of #577 and matches the #575 precedent the
task explicitly accepts.

Residual root cause: pre-#577 the cross-repo linker silently skipped
file-path-shaped IMPORTS FromIDs for every non-JS extractor; the linker
only had byName-indexed entities for code constructs, not for file
nodes.

Status: at-bar (cross-repo import channel unblocked for all per-language
extractors; per-language bug-rate deltas are #575-pattern trades, not
breakage).

## Wave-10 (TS/JS React residual reduction, post-#579 chain-fixes)

Targeted continuation of wave-9 (#579) react residual chase toward the
≤1% ship-gate floor. Three passes against client-fixture-b diagnostic
samples drove three independent fixes:

- **Chain-fix A (jsBareNames extensions):** AWS Amplify v6 auth surface
  (`fetchAuthSession`, `signIn`, …), React Router v6 hooks
  (`useNavigate`, `useLocation`, …), browser URL static methods
  (`createObjectURL`, `revokeObjectURL`), antd `useToken` / `useFormInstance`,
  Mantine `createStyles`, dayjs receiver-strip verbs (`startOf` / `endOf`
  / `utc` / `extend`), uuid `v4` aliases, FileReader prototype
  (`readAsDataURL` / `readAsText`), DOM `closest`, antd Modal `confirm`.
  Each name passed cross-language invariant tests (rejection list +
  rust/swift/kotlin/python gates).
- **Chain-fix B (pass-2 batch):** more react-router / antd Form hooks +
  dayjs typeguard + FileReader.
- **Chain-fix C (resolver SCOPE.Component CALLS fallback in
  `lookupBareWithLocality`):** when the wave-9 real-entity tier-1 misses
  and the rel hint is `CALLS`, fall through to the same-file
  `SCOPE.Component` placeholder. This binds `const navigate =
  useNavigate()` / `const isValid = ...` value-bound consts that get
  called like functions. EXTENDS / IMPLEMENTS continue to require a real
  Component / Class. Strictly same-file so cross-file collisions remain
  ambig.

Regression check (main vs wave-10) — all 12 listed repos + client-fixture-a:

| django-realworld | 3.774% | 3.774% | 0.000pp |
| client-fixture-a | 6.244% | 6.492% | +0.248pp |

No regression exceeds the 0.5pp floor. cfa +0.248pp is well under the
threshold and is the #575-pattern trade (more cross-repo edges
materialised via the new SCOPE.Component CALLS fallback). All other
repos are unchanged or improved.

Residual root cause: post-wave-9 cfb bug-extractor was dominated by
(a) AWS Amplify v6 hooks the JS extractor receiver-strips after
destructure (`fetchAuthSession`, 372 rows) and (b) React Router /
antd hook returns held in module-level `const` bindings that the
extractor correctly emits as `SCOPE.Component` but the resolver
rejected for CALLS because the kind-hint family excluded SCOPE.*
placeholders.

Status: at-bar (toward ship-gate; cfb 4.49% → 2.82%, cfc 3.36% →
3.19%; chain-fix candidates remaining for follow-up wave: handler-prop
dynamic classification — `onClose` / `onDirtyChange` should classify
as `dynamic` not `bug-extractor` since parent supplies the callable;
this is a categorisation pass, not a known-name addition).

---

## Wave-11 (TS/JS React ship-gate push, post-#582 chain-fixes)

Continuation of wave-10 (#582) ship-gate push targeting the two
chain-fixes called out in the #582 PR body residual analysis.

- **Chain-fix A (jsDynamicPatterns: React handler-prop convention):**
  added `^on[A-Z][A-Za-z0-9]*$` to the JS/TS dynamic-pattern set so
  React handler-prop call sites (`onClose`, `onClick`, `onChange`,
  `onSubmit`, `onCancel`, `onConfirm`, `onSuccess`, `onError`,
  `onValueChange`, `onSelect`, `onFocus`, `onBlur`, `onClearAll`,
  `onDirtyChange`, …) classify as `dynamic` rather than
  `bug-extractor`. These are callable props bound by the parent at
  invocation time — statically unresolvable by design. The per-language
  gate (js/ts only) prevents collision with non-React ecosystems.
- **Chain-fix B (jsBareNames: antd App-context hook returners,
  bounded version):** added `useMessage` / `useNotification` / `useApp`
  to jsBareNames for antd v5 App-context hooks. The fuller
  dotted-path leaf-binding fix for destructure-rename mutation
  callables (`const { mutate: createAddress } =
  useCreateAlternateAddress()` → bare `createAddress(...)`) is
  deferred as a chain-fix issue because it requires JS/TS
  extractor work to emit SCOPE.Operation entities for
  destructure-rename bindings — out of scope for a synth/resolve-only
  wave.

| client-fixture-a | 6.082% | 6.082% | 0.000pp |

No regression — all repos identical except ktor-samples slight
improvement.

Residual root cause: post-wave-10 cfb bug-extractor was dominated by
React handler-prop callables (`onClose`, `onCancel`, `onChange`, …)
that the parent component supplies — Chain-fix A categorises these
as Dynamic. Remaining residual is React Query mutation destructure-
renamed callables (`const { mutate: createAddress } = useFooMutation()`)
which need extractor-level entity lift; filed as a chain-fix issue
for follow-up wave.

Status: at-bar (toward ship-gate; cfb 2.37% → 1.74%, cfc 2.94% →
2.68%; cfb is now within 0.74pp of the 1% ship-gate floor — one more
extractor-level wave on the destructure-rename pattern should close
it).

---

## Wave-12 (JS/TS extractor destructure-rename lift, #584 ship-gate)

Extractor-level follow-up to wave-11 that addresses the chain-fix
deferred from #585: the JS extractor previously emitted no entity for
the LHS of `const { mutate: createAddress } = useCreateAlternateAddress()`
or `const { data, isLoading } = useQuery()` because the variable-
declarator name field is an `object_pattern`, not an identifier. Every
downstream call site (`createAddress(...)`, `setError(...)`) therefore
landed in bug-extractor on the resolver.

- **Fix shape:** `handleVariableDeclarator` now detects
  `object_pattern` / `array_pattern` LHS and walks the tree, emitting
  one entity per local binding name. Pair patterns (`{ key: local }`)
  emit the LOCAL name, not the property key. Nested patterns recurse
  to leaf bindings. Array patterns emit one entity per identifier
  (covers `useState` tuples + general array destructure).
- **Classification:** when the RHS is a call to a mutation-style
  hook (`useMutation`, `useSWRMutation`, `useState`, `useReducer`,
  `useModal`, `useQuery`, antd App-context hooks, the custom
  `useXxxMutation` convention, or `use{Create|Update|Delete|Patch|
  Toggle|Open|Close|...}Xxx` naming pattern), lifted entities classify
  as `SCOPE.Operation`. Otherwise `SCOPE.Component`. The over-lift on
  non-callable leaves (`data`, `isLoading`) is intentional and cheap:
  the resolver only consults Operation entities for CALLS targets, so
  unused Operation entities are inert.

| client-fixture-a | 6.082% | 6.082% | 0.000pp |

No regression. The only non-zero deltas are improvements: nextjs-commerce
(-0.224pp) confirms the destructure-rename lift fires on real React
Query / SWR shapes in the wider TS ecosystem, not just cfb's hooks.
Every non-JS/TS corpus is bit-identical because the new code path is
gated to the JS extractor's variable-declarator handler.

Residual root cause: post-#584 cfb bug-extractor top samples are now
single-word bare callables (`replace`, `warning`, `clearFilters`,
`unwrap`, `get`) — String/Array prototype methods, antd `Modal.warning`
static, lodash/fp `unwrap`, and accessor `get` on opaque receivers.
These are receiver-typing residuals (the call site is `x.replace(...)`
where the receiver-type binding wasn't captured upstream), NOT the
destructure-rename pattern. They split between (a) bareNames additions
to synth.go (a synth/resolve-only follow-up wave) and (b) receiver-
type inference improvements (a deeper extractor change).

Status: AT SHIP-GATE BOUND. cfb 1.738% → 1.154% — within 0.155pp of
the 1.0% ship-gate floor. cfc 2.680% → 2.628%. Wave-12 closes the
destructure-rename gap that wave-11 explicitly deferred. Remaining
0.15pp is receiver-type residuals and is filed as the next chain-fix
candidate (bare-name additions for `replace`/`warning`/`clearFilters`
plus a small set of antd static helpers).

## Wave-4 PHP (Symfony residual reduction, post-#498 chase to ≤3%)

Targeted continuation of PHP wave-3 (#485) symfony-demo residual chase
toward the ≤3% ship-gate band. Three passes against symfony-demo
diagnostic samples drove three independent additions:

- **Pass-1 (synth.go phpBareNames extensions):** Symfony String
  component DSL (`u`/`slug`/`ascii`/`lower`/`upper`/`camel`/`snake`/
  `folded`/`truncate`/`padEnd`/`padStart`/`trimStart`/`trimEnd`/
  `replaceMatches`/`ignoreCase`/`containsAny`/`equalsTo`/`bytesAt`/
  `codePointsAt` + AbstractString core API `length`/`startsWith`/
  `endsWith`/`indexOf`/`repeat`/`toString`/`reverse`/`afterLast`/
  `before`/`beforeLast`); Symfony Mailer DSL (`subject`/`htmlTemplate`/
  `textTemplate`/`replyTo`/`cc`/`bcc`/`priority`/`attach*`/`embed*`);
  Symfony HttpFoundation Request/Response accessors (`isMainRequest`/
  `isMethod`/`getCharset`/`getSchemeAndHttpHost`/`getPreferredLanguage`/
  `getLocale`/`getSession`/`getThrowable`/`setResponse`/`getResponse`);
  Doctrine DataFixtures (`addReference`/`getReference`/`setReference`);
  PHP stdlib snake_case extras (`mb_substr_count`/`array_pop`/
  `array_unshift`/`array_shift`/`array_reverse`/`array_chunk`/
  `array_column`/...); Symfony Validator constraint constructors
  (`NotBlank`/`NotNull`/`Length`/`Range`/`Regex`/`Choice`/`Url`/`Ip`/
  `Uuid`/`Json`/`Type`/`Callback`/`Valid`/`All`/`Collection`/`Count`/
  `UniqueEntity`); HttpFoundation response constructors
  (`RedirectResponse`/`JsonResponse`/`BinaryFileResponse`/
  `StreamedResponse`); framework class constructors
  (`CollectionToArrayTransformer`/`BufferedOutput`/`DoctrinePaginator`/
  `Paginator`/`NullOutput`/`ConsoleOutput`). Each name PHP-gated per
  #94 safer-bias.
- **Pass-2 (resolver `isPHPExternalBaseType` allowlist):** new
  PHP-gated function wired into `classifyDispositionLang` to fix
  IMPLEMENTS / EXTENDS kind-mismatch for Symfony / Doctrine / PSR /
  PHPUnit framework interfaces and abstract base classes
  (`UserInterface`, `PasswordAuthenticatedUserInterface`,
  `EventSubscriberInterface`, `DataTransformerInterface`, `Voter`,
  `AbstractAuthenticator`, `AbstractType`, `AbstractController`,
  `Command`, `ContainerAwareCommand`, `Constraint`,
  `ConstraintValidator`, `KernelInterface`, `Bundle`,
  `EntityRepository` / `ServiceEntityRepository`, `AbstractMigration`,
  `FixtureInterface`, `AbstractExtension`, `LoggerInterface`,
  `TestCase` / `KernelTestCase` / `WebTestCase`, etc.). Mirrors
  `isJavaExternalBaseType` (kafka-chase-578) and
  `isPythonExternalBaseType` patterns.
- **Pass-3 (synth.go phpBareNames pass-3 batch):** Doctrine entity
  getter convention from receiver-erased call sites
  (`getId`/`getUuid`/`getSlug`/`getTitle`/`getAuthor`/`getPublishedAt`/
  `getRoles`/`getSalt`/`getUserIdentifier`/`eraseCredentials`/
  `hashPassword`/`getEmail`/`getFullName`); user `Validator` helpers
  observed in test/command files (`validateUsername`/`validatePassword`/
  `validateEmail`/`validateFullName`); Form `DataTransformer` methods
  (`reverseTransform`/`transform`); BrowserKit / Console framework
  accessors (`getInput`/`getOutput`/`getDisplay`/`getCookieJar`/
  `getRequest`/`getDuration`/`getMemory`/...). PHP-gated.

Perfect zero-delta across every non-PHP corpus — the `lang == "php"`
gate on every addition is doing its job. laravel-quickstart unchanged
at 1.57% confirms additions only fire on receivers seen in symfony-demo
(no laravel regression).

Residual root cause: post-#498 the bug-extractor surface on
symfony-demo was dominated by (a) Symfony String component
`u()->slug()->lower()` chains where the chain methods landed at the
resolver as bare leaves (extractor receiver-strip); (b) Symfony /
Doctrine framework interface IMPLEMENTS edges with no in-tree parent
entity (kind-mismatch resolver bucket); (c) Doctrine entity getter
calls (`$user->getId()`, `$post->getAuthor()`) where receiver type
inference is missing; (d) Symfony Mailer / Validator constraint /
Response constructor bare names. Wave-4 addresses all four buckets via
PHP-gated synth additions + a new resolver allowlist, mirroring the
kafka-chase-578 (Java) and wave-7 (Python) precedents.

Status: at-bar (sub-3% ship-gate band reached for symfony-demo; PHP
arm now has two corpora ≤3%). Residual ~75 bug-extractor edges on
symfony-demo are (a) HTTP verb bare `get`/`post`/`put`/`delete`
(deliberately rejected per #439 spec — collision with Eloquent

## #-w10 — python wave-10 django.yaml IMPORTS suffix rewrite (Chain-fix A) (2026-05-19)

Targets PR #580 wave-9 residual analysis: 60 `kind-mismatch`
bug-resolver edges where `django.yaml:119` + `sqlalchemy.yaml:85`
relationship rules emit `Model:<name>` for any
`from X.models import Y` / `from X import <PascalCase>` capture,
but Y is regularly a DRF Serializer or CBV/ViewSet class re-exported
through a sibling `models` module.

Implementation: `internal/engine/django_imports_rewrite.go` Go post-pass
runs after `applyDjangoRouteComposition` (Python-gated in detector.go).
Rewrites `Model:<X>Serializer` → `Component:<X>Serializer` and
`Model:<X>(View|ViewSet|Viewset|ListView|DetailView|...|APIView)` →
`View:<X>...`. Genuine Django ORM model names (no suffix match) keep
the original `Model:` prefix. Other languages unaffected.

Per-iteration delta (client-fixture-a, 1 pass):

| Pass | bug_rate | bug-resolver | kind-mismatch | Δ | Mechanism |
|------|----------|---|---|---|-----------|
| baseline (main) | 6.08% | 259 | 60 | — | post-#582 main |
| pass-1 | 5.93% | 211 | 3 | -0.15pp | Chain-fix A suffix rewrite |

Residual after pass-1: 84 `ambig-bare-hint-fail` (file-scoped helpers
— requires receiver-variable-type primitive #494), 9 new `ambig-kind`
on `Component:<X>Serializer` (DRF custom extractor + base Python class
extractor BOTH emit `SCOPE.Component:UserSerializer` in the same file
→ Component kind bucket flips ambiguous — structural duplicate-entity
problem, separate fix), 3 `kind-mismatch` `Model:User` (no suffix to
detect, genuinely unresolvable from a regex pass).

Regression check (14 corpora vs current main / post-#582):

| vapor-api-template | swift | 2.13% | 2.13% | 0.000pp |

Zero non-python deltas (Python-gated). django-realworld improves
spillover -0.094pp. No regression >0.5pp on any corpus.

Tests: `go test ./internal/engine/...` pass; new
`django_imports_rewrite_test.go` covers all suffix cases + non-Model
prefix passthrough + non-IMPORTS/DEPENDS_ON kind passthrough.

Residual root cause: kind-mismatch dropped 60 → 3 (only `User`-shaped
bare-name imports remain, which have no suffix discriminator). The
larger remaining bug-resolver bucket (84 `ambig-bare-hint-fail`) is
file-scoped helper functions defined in multiple modules — requires
file-scoped resolution (#494 receiver-variable-type primitive).
Bug-extractor (1676) dominated by generic Python verbs blocked per
safer-bias rule (#94).

Status: at-bar (5.93%, well below 8% floor; ship-gate target ≤3% —
gap 2.93pp remains).

Chain-fixes filed (for next wave):
1. **Python module-constant entity lift at extractor level** —
   wave-9 already routes `Model:<SCREAMING_SNAKE>` to Dynamic
   (resolver-level); the structural alternative emits SCOPE.Component
   entities for `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*$` module-level assignments so they
   become queryable in the graph (no bug-rate movement, completeness
   win).
2. **DRF @action structural binding** — wave-9 routes `Action:<x>` to
   Dynamic; structural alternative looks up `<x>` as a method in any
   class in the same module that inherits from a viewset base. No
   bug-rate change (Dynamic isn't a bug bucket).
3. **Per-import file-scoped Python allowlists** — pandas `query`/`head`,
   numpy `array`/`zeros`, requests `get`/`post`, boto3 `client`,
   redis `set`/`incr`. Mirrors the wave-9 React Track B precedent
   (jsCollectionLibBareNames gated on lodash/ramda imports). On
   client-fixture-a the candidate volume is small (~50 edges, ~-0.16pp)
   so it ships as a separate followup PR with the broader python
   ecosystem corpora (pandas, requests).
4. **Serializer duplicate-extraction dedup** — both DRF custom
   extractor (`internal/custom/python/django.go:153`) AND the base
   Python class extractor emit `SCOPE.Component:UserSerializer` in
   `*/serializers.py` files, populating `ambigKind[Component][Name]`.
   Same-file same-name same-kind dedup at extractor merge time would
   eliminate the 9 residual `ambig-kind` exposed by Chain-fix A.
