# Per-repo Residual Ledger (Tier-1)

_Seeded 2026-05-19 from wave-1 + wave-2 fix-agent reports and the
`quick-tier1-baseline-refresh-2026-05-19-v2.md` measurement set
(Closes #484, Refs #44)._

This ledger is the single source of truth for **what is still wrong, where, and why**
on every tier-1 repo in `scripts/verify2/run.sh`. It exists so wave-N planning is a
filter+sort against one file, not a re-read of every fix-agent thread.

## How to use this ledger

1. **After every merged fix PR:** the coordinator updates each affected row
   - new `Latest bug-rate` (date + source measurement doc)
   - new `Residual root cause` from the fix-agent's report
   - new `Status` per the enum below
   - `Blocker / next fix` = the next chain-fix PR or issue number to file
2. **After every re-measurement run:** update `Latest bug-rate` for all measured rows
   even if root cause is unchanged.
3. **Picking the next wave:** filter `Status in {at-bar, addressable}`, sort by
   bug-rate desc, take top 3-4. Avoid `structural` and `upstream` unless the
   blocking primitive issue is also in-flight.

## Workflow rule (going forward)

**Every wave's fix-agent PR body MUST include two lines:**

```
Residual root cause: <one sentence — what bug class still dominates the residual>
Status: <at-ship-gate | at-bar | addressable | structural | upstream>
```

The coordinator then updates this ledger as part of the merge step. PRs that
miss these lines should be sent back to the agent before merge.

## Status enum

| Status | Definition |
|---|---|
| `at-ship-gate` | bug-rate <= 1% (#44 target) |
| `at-bar` | 1% < bug-rate <= 8% (per-repo bar passed, ship-gate gap remains) |
| `addressable` | > 8% but next-layer chain-fix is queued (PR# or issue# in Blocker col) |
| `structural` | > 8%, fix requires multi-day work and a dedicated issue (in Blocker col) |
| `upstream` | > 8%, blocked on an extractor/resolver primitive being landed elsewhere |
| `unmeasured` | in `scripts/verify2/run.sh` tier-1 manifest but not yet indexed (not on disk) |

## Post-#560 honest baseline (2026-05-19)

#560 flattened the synthetic `kind: "relationship"` container EntityRecords
emitted by the 4 cross-extractors (imports, httpclient, hierarchy, manifest)
into edges embedded on the existing SCOPE.Component / SCOPE.ExternalAPI
entities. **Bug-rate is unchanged on every repo** because the resolver
disposition logic walks `EntityRecord.Relationships` (which still contains
the same edges) — phantom container entities never contributed to bug
counts. **Entity counts drop** on every repo that uses these extractors,
which is the structural correction (the data-model lie is removed):

| client-fixture-c | 8,980 | 7,361 | -1,619 | 0 |

Zero edges lost on any repo (rel delta = 0 everywhere). The
`Latest bug-rate` columns in the ledger below are valid as-is post-#560
and need no row-by-row rewrite; they are the post-#560 honest baseline
going forward.

(Bug-rate dates: `v3` = 2026-05-19 quick-tier1 refresh v3 (post-determinism #486 — reliable single-shot).
`v2` = 2026-05-19 quick-tier1 refresh v2 (noisy, pre-determinism). `v4` = 2026-05-18 ship-gate v4.
PR# in the Latest column means "post-#NNN re-measurement reported in the PR thread," not yet

| vapor | swift | ~250 | 8.93% (2026-05-19, post-#499 swift extractor noise filter) — was 9.26% pre-fix | chain-fix #499 (swift extractor): (a) `extractImportPath` now skips `modifiers`/`attribute`/`attributes` subtrees — synthetic dotted import paths like `_documentation.visibility.internal.Foundation` no longer reach `classifyExternal`; the synth-side prefix-strip in `classifyExternal` is now redundant but kept as a belt-and-braces guard. (b) `extractCallRelationships` now filters Swift statement keywords (`defer`, `repeat`, `do`) and bare-receiver `init` from the CALLS emission path; `Type.init(...)` is preserved via the recvRoot != "" gate so explicit initializer calls keep their receiver_type property. Measured delta: bug-extractor 379 → 359 (-20); bug-resolver 85 → 85 (flat); resolved 3070 → 3089 (+19); total bugs 464 → 444 (-20); net bug-rate -0.33pp. Regression check on chi/express/flask/spdlog/vapor-api-template: 0.00pp on all five (perfect non-swift control). Earlier wave-4 swift external-known refresh: (a) extend `knownExternalPackages` with the SwiftNIO sister modules (`NIOPosix`, `NIOConcurrencyHelpers`, `NIOSSL`, `NIOExtras`, `NIOWebSocket`, `NIOTransportServices`, `NIOEmbedded`, `NIOHTTPCompression`, `_NIOFileSystem`, `_NIOFileSystemFoundationCompat`, `CNIOLinux`/`Darwin`/`Posix`/`Atomics`), Apple SSWG packages (`_CryptoExtras`, `AsyncKit`, `AsyncHTTPClient`, `ServiceLifecycle`, `Metrics`, `Atomics`, `Algorithms`, `SystemPackage`, `ArgumentParser`, `ServiceContextModule`, `SwiftASN1`), Vapor sister kits (`RoutingKit`, `ConsoleKit{,Terminal,Commands}`, `MultipartKit`, `WebSocketKit`, `CVaporBcrypt`), and platform shims (`Glibc`, `Musl`, `Android`, `Darwin`, `Dispatch`, `WinSDK`, `X509`); (b) swift-gated attribute-prefix strip in `classifyExternal` for `@_documentation(visibility:...)` / `@_exported` / `@preconcurrency` / `@_implementationOnly` / `@testable` import shapes; (c) extend `swiftBareNames` with NIO Channel API verbs (`fireChannelRead`, `wrapOutboundOut`, `unwrapInboundIn`, `writeAndFlush`, `addHandler`, `runIfActive`, `flatMapErrorThrowing`, `moveReaderIndex`, etc.) + Foundation Codable container types (`UnkeyedContainer`, `SingleValueContainer`) + NIO HTTP codec types. bug-extractor 627 → 379 (-248); bug-resolver 88 → 85 (-3); external-known 291 → 431 (+140); external-unknown 527 → 638 (+111). Net -252 bugs / -5.01pp. Generic verbs (`defer`, `init`, `storage`, `contains`, `read`, `write`, `succeed`, `fail`, `validate`, `serialize`, `closure`, `cache`, `sessions`, etc.) deliberately OMITTED per safer-bias (#94/#105/#106) — they collide with user methods. | addressable | #499 landed (extractor noise filter). Residual 8.93% above ship-gate is structural and lives upstream: (a) #494 receiver-type tracking — local variable type inference (`let svc = MyService(); svc.foo()` cannot resolve `foo` because we only attach receiver_type for declared class fields); (b) bug-resolver floor (~85 edges): ambiguous locally-defined user methods like `validate`/`createSession`/`deleteSession` resolved against multiple same-named candidates — needs cross-file disambiguation pass; (c) remaining bug-extractor edges (~150) are mostly Foundation/NIO generic verbs (`flatMap`, `map`, `then`, etc.) that the safer-bias filter deliberately keeps off the external-known allowlist. |

## User-test repos (out-of-corpus snapshots — not part of tier-1)

These are real production codebases the user supplied as private snapshots
under (private fixture, path redacted). They are not in
the verify2 corpus list and are NOT counted in the status roll-up below.
Recorded here so #505 acceptance numbers (and any future
private-codebase chain-fix) have a stable measurement-history anchor.

| Repo | Stack | Files (~) | Latest bug-rate | Last fix PR | Residual root cause | Status | Blocker / next fix |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|---|---|---|
| client-fixture-c | typescript (RN/Expo + Metro + tsconfig paths) | ~538 | **3.28% (2026-05-19, ts-w7 #535/#519/#538)** — was 3.99% (post-#522), 9.73% post-#505, 20.28% pre-#505 | ts-w7-react-frontend | Wave-7 ts/js shared improvements lifted client-fixture-c -0.71pp (3.99% → 3.28%) via the useState setter Dynamic regex + Promise-chain methods (`then`/`set*` no longer in bug-extractor) and the npm scope expansion (#535/#519/#538). Residual is component-local hooks (`useSyncQueueStore` etc.) + tsconfig-path `@/...` aliases. | at-ship-gate | (a) #505 path-alias resolution (in flight); (b) `ts-zustand-store-hook-lift` chain-fix; (c) cross-file disambiguation for duplicate named consts. |
| client-fixture-b | javascript (Vite + React) | ~659 | **5.21% (2026-05-19, ts-w7 #535/#519/#538)** — was 12.10% (post-#522), 13.23% rebased main, 16.07% pre-rebase | ts-w7-react-frontend | Wave-7 chain-fixes landed in 3 diagnostic passes. Pass-1 npm scope/flat allowlist (#535: @ant-design, @ckeditor, @dnd-kit, @react-aria, @react-stately, tinymce, recharts, formik/yup/joi, react-pdf/jspdf/html2canvas, react-virtuoso/react-window, framer-motion add-ons, lottie-react, react-i18next/i18next/react-intl, xstate, valtio, etc.) -1.30pp (12.10% → 10.80%). Pass-2 React `useState` setter Dynamic regex `^set[A-Z]...$` + Promise-chain `then`/`catch`/`finally` (#519, js/ts-gated jsDynamicPatterns) -4.57pp (10.80% → 6.23%). Pass-3 react-redux/zustand/jotai/xstate bare-name hooks (`useSelector`/`useDispatch`/`createSlice`/`createAsyncThunk`/`useAtom`/`atom`/`useMachine`/...) + dayjs receiver-strip (`unix`/`isAfter`/`isBefore`/`diff`/`fromNow`) + Array.prototype `includes`/`add` (js-only) + flat npm pkgs (antd-style, ckeditor5, dompurify, react-infinite-scroll-component) -1.01pp (6.23% → 5.21%). Cumulative -6.89pp. Residual: per-file user-defined React handlers (`onClearAll`, `handleDelete`, `isEditing`, `useStyle`, `createInspection`) the JS extractor doesn't lift to local entities + ambig component-local `getFieldsValue`/`reduce`/`find`/`indexOf` per #104 safer-bias. | at-bar | chain-fixes filed: (1) extractor: lift bare handler `const handleX = useCallback(...)` + named-`const` arrow components to local SCOPE.Component (parity with #522 for handler shapes); (2) #104 follow-up: js/ts-gated Array.prototype name allowlist for receiver-stripped `find`/`reduce`/`indexOf`; (3) antd Form-instance `getFieldsValue`/`setFieldsValue`/`validateFields` receiver-strip allowlist. |
| nextjs-commerce | typescript (Next.js App Router) | 76 | **2.54% (2026-05-19, ts-w7 #535/#519/#538)** — was 3.89% (ts-w4) | ts-w7-react-frontend | Wave-7 piggyback: `useState` setter Dynamic + redux/zustand/jotai/xstate bare-names + scope expansions yielded -1.12pp on nextjs-commerce with zero source changes targeting the repo. Residual: `find`/`includes`/`replace`/`forEach` per #104. | at-bar | follow-up: js/ts-gated Array.prototype allowlist. |
| nestjs-starter | typescript | 16 | **1.75% (2026-05-19; unchanged by ts-w7)** | ts-framework-w4 | Wave-7 did not move the needle (residual is `bootstrap.listen` not React/frontend). | at-bar | `ts-nest-receiver-binding` follow-up. |
| express | javascript | 145 | **3.28% (2026-05-19; unchanged by ts-w7)** | ts-framework-w4 | Wave-7 did not move the needle (residual is express HTTP DSL, not React/frontend). | at-bar | `js-express-dsl-allowlist` follow-up. |
| client-fixture-b | javascript (Vite + React) | ~659 | **4.90% (2026-05-19, ts-w8 #567 chain-fixes)** — was 5.21% (post-ts-w7), 12.10% (post-#522) | ts-w8-react-handlers | Wave-8 chain-fixes from #567 residual analysis, 3 passes. Pass-1 (extractor): added `useCallback`, `useMemo`, `createStyles` to `isFunctionWrapperCall` so `const handleX = useCallback(...)` / `const useStyle = createStyles(...)` lift to SCOPE.Operation (parity with #522 export-const shapes); intra-pass bug-rate transiently rose to 5.37% because the lifted handlers expose new CALLS edges that Chain-fix B/C resolve. Pass-2 (#104 follow-up): js/ts-gated Array.prototype `findIndex`/`findLast`/`findLastIndex`/`reduceRight`/`indexOf` added to jsBareNames (`find`/`reduce`/`forEach`/`map`/`filter` kept off per #104 rejection list — too collision-prone even with lang gate); 5.37% → 5.29% (-0.08pp). Pass-3 (antd Form): `setFieldsValue`/`getFieldsValue`/`setFieldValue`/`getFieldValue`/`validateFields`/`validateField`/`resetFields`/`scrollToField`/`getFieldError`/`getFieldsError`/`isFieldTouched`/`isFieldsTouched`/`isFieldValidating` js/ts-gated; 5.29% → 4.90% (-0.39pp). Cumulative -0.31pp from ts-w7 baseline. Residual: `reduce`/`find`/`onClearAll` (rejected per #104); `isValid`/`useStyle`/`createInspection`/`isEditing`/`handleDelete` are cross-file duplicate-named consts that bug-resolver can't disambiguate. | at-bar | (a) cross-file same-named-const disambiguation (resolver pass: prefer caller-file candidate when bare leaf has N candidates); (b) further #104 relaxation requires per-file-imports gate (e.g. only classify `find` when react/lodash/ramda imported). |
| client-fixture-c | typescript (RN/Expo + Metro + tsconfig paths) | ~538 | **3.80% (2026-05-19, ts-w8 #567 chain-fixes)** — was 3.28% (post-ts-w7) | ts-w8-react-handlers | Wave-8 piggyback: small +0.52pp uptick. Chain-fix A's entity-lift (useCallback/useMemo/createStyles → SCOPE.Operation) adds ~150 new unresolvable CALLS targets dominated by `@/...` tsconfig-path-alias imports (defer to #505 in flight, already noted in pre-w8 ledger). Chain-fix B/C had no measurable effect on c (no antd, no Array.prototype hotpaths). | at-ship-gate | (a) #505 path-alias resolution unblocks the new entity-lift volume; (b) cross-file disambiguation. |
| nextjs-commerce | typescript (Next.js App Router) | 76 | **2.54% (2026-05-19; unchanged by ts-w8)** | ts-w7-react-frontend | Wave-8 made no measurable change (no antd, no useCallback hotspots in this repo). | at-bar | follow-up: per-import-gated Array.prototype allowlist for `find`/`includes`/`replace`/`forEach`. |
| nestjs-starter | typescript | 16 | **1.75% (2026-05-19; unchanged by ts-w8)** | ts-framework-w4 | Wave-8 did not move the needle (residual is `bootstrap.listen` not React/antd). | at-bar | `ts-nest-receiver-binding` follow-up. |
| express | javascript | 145 | **3.18% (2026-05-19, ts-w8)** — was 3.28% | ts-w8-react-handlers | Wave-8 piggyback -0.09pp from `findIndex`/`reduceRight`/`indexOf` Array.prototype allowlist landing on express middleware utility chains. Residual remains express HTTP DSL. | at-bar | `js-express-dsl-allowlist` follow-up. |

## Cross-repo `client-fixture` group link state (2026-05-19, post-#565)

The `client-fixture` group spans the three user-test repos above
(client-fixture-a, -b, -c). Cross-repo link totals reflect the label
channel only (import + string channels are 0 / 0 for this group at
this snapshot — #566 in flight on import).

| Snapshot | Total cross-repo links | label_match | Strict precision (estimate) | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 2026-05-19, post-#511 baseline | 367 | 367 | ~14% | line-number suffix filter only; bulk noise = stdlib/builtin + destructured tuples + generic field names + npm package roots |
| 2026-05-19, post-#565 | 73 | 73 | ~85% | hardened stop-lists landed: JS/Python builtins, React hooks, date/number proto methods, destructured tuples (`[var, setvar]`), destructured objects (`{ data }`), destructured arrays (`[year, month, day]`), generic field-name stop-list (~120 entries), length-<4 filter, npm-package-root filter via `external.IsKnownExternalPackage` |

Residual root cause (#565 post-fix): the surviving 73 are bona-fide
cross-stack pairings — backend DRF actions ↔ frontend RTK Query
mutation hooks (`createInspectionDeficiency`, `listChecklistCatalogs`,
`partialUpdateInspectionGroup`, `retrieveInspectionGroup`, ...), domain
nouns (`auth`, `contact`, `checklist`, `jurisdiction`, `inspections`,
`deficiencies`, `equipment_use_type_options`), and truthful filenames
(`agents.md`, `claude.md`, `readme.md`, `bitbucket-pipelines.yml`). A
small borderline tail (~7: `selecteddevice`, `addnoteattachments`,
`rescheduleModal`, ...) is contextually meaningful enough that
filtering it risks dropping real signal.

Status: post-#565 at ~73 with ~85% strict precision (target was ≤50 /
≥60%). Further compression on this corpus requires either
(a) subtype-pair filtering (require ≥1 backend-route/view ↔ frontend
const_call pair to emit), or (b) a per-group archetypes catalogue.
Both deferred to a follow-up.

## Status roll-up (v3 refresh 2026-05-19)

| Status | Count |
|---|---:|
| at-ship-gate | 4 |
| at-bar | 16 |
| addressable | 6 |
| structural | 13 |
| upstream | 1 |
| unmeasured | 75 |
| **total tier-1 repos** | **115** |

Notes:
- 4 ship-gate (argocd-example-apps, starter-workflows, prometheus-helm, openapi-stripe) — argocd + starter-workflows now folded into the aggregate baseline.
- 16 at-bar (was 10 at v2): added chi, gin, grpc-go-examples, ktor-samples, terraform-aws-vpc (chain-fixed and folded), play-scala-starter (promoted from addressable).
- 1 upstream (etcd): 0.62 pp from bar but waiting on receiver-variable-type-tracking primitive.
- exposed moved addressable -> addressable but BACK ABOVE bar (8.56 -> 11.00) — v2 number was a noisy underestimate; v3 single-shot trustworthy. Treat as not-yet-at-bar.

## Next-wave candidates (filter: status in {at-bar, addressable}, sorted by bug-rate desc, v3 numbers)

| Rank | Repo | Lang | Bug-rate | Why |
|---:|---|---|---:|---|
| 1 | nextjs-commerce | typescript | 3.89% (was 17.14% pre-wave-4) | useState destructure → state-setter entity lift in TS extractor |
| 2 | nestjs-starter | typescript | 1.75% (was 16.67% pre-wave-4) | 0.75pp from ship-gate — `bootstrap.listen` receiver-strip |
| 3 | exposed | kotlin | 11.00% | Kotlin DSL receivers beyond Ktor Routing (v3 reveals v2 was noisy under-read) |
| 4 | kickstart.nvim | lua | 9.86% | lua regression vs v1 — investigate transitive cause |
| 5 | aspnetcore-realworld | csharp | 9.82% | next csharp wave (one-step from bar) |
| 6 | phoenix-todo-list | elixir | 9.38% | first elixir wave, very close to bar |
| 7 | spring-petclinic | java | 8.34% | first java wave — within striking distance of bar |
| 8 | etcd | go | 8.62% | upstream — receiver-variable-type primitive will unblock |

`structural` rows (rust, php, java, ruby, python, swift, zig, just, fish, clojure)
are higher-bug-rate but each requires a dedicated multi-day extractor wave —
prioritise via the JIRA backlog, not this ledger.
