# Install

Full install matrix for grafel. For the five-command path see [quickstart.md](quickstart.md).

---

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| Go 1.26+ | CGO must be enabled (tree-sitter uses a C library) |
| C/C++ compiler | macOS: `xcode-select --install` / Debian-Ubuntu: `apt install build-essential` / Windows: MinGW-w64 (UCRT) via MSYS2 — set **both** `CC` (gcc) and `CXX` (g++): tree-sitter is C, its `yaml` grammar is C++. `CGO_ENABLED=0` → "build constraints exclude all Go files"; missing `CXX` → `exec: "g++": not found`. |
| Node.js 20+ + npm | Dashboard build only — not needed at runtime after `make build` |
| git | Required for indexing |

---

## macOS / Linux — installer script

The recommended install path. Downloads the latest release binary, verifies it, and places `grafel` under `~/.grafel/bin`.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cajasmota/grafel/main/install.sh | bash
```

The script respects `GRAFEL_VERSION` (pin a release tag), `GRAFEL_PREFIX` (install location, default `~/.grafel`), and `GRAFEL_FORCE=1` (overwrite an existing install).

---

## Windows — PowerShell installer

The recommended install path on Windows. Downloads the latest release binary into `%USERPROFILE%\.grafel`.

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cajasmota/grafel/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

Windows builds require MSYS2/MinGW64. The installer handles this. Shipped binaries link statically against MinGW — users do not need MinGW installed at runtime.

---

## Pre-built binary (manual download)

Release archives are published at https://github.com/cajasmota/grafel/releases for those who prefer a manual download over the installer script.

Archives per platform: `linux_x86_64`, `linux_arm64`, `macos_x86_64`, `macos_arm64`, `windows_x86_64`.

Extract the archive and move the `grafel` binary to a directory on your `PATH`.

---

## Build from source

For contributors, or if you prefer to build the binary yourself.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cajasmota/grafel.git
cd grafel
make build           # builds dashboard (npm ci + vite build) + Go binary
./grafel --version
```

`make build` runs `dashboard-build` (npm) then `go build`. If you only want the Go binary and the dashboard is already built:

```sh
make build-go-only
```

To install the binary system-wide:

```sh
go install -ldflags="-X main.commit=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)" ./cmd/grafel
# installs to ~/go/bin -- ensure ~/go/bin is on PATH
```

---

## Dev mode (symlinked skills)

For contributors who want to edit skills in-place and see changes without reinstalling:

```sh
grafel install --dev
```

This creates symlinks in `~/.claude/skills/` pointing back to `skills/` in the source checkout instead of copying files.

---

## Post-install steps

```sh
grafel doctor               # smoke-check install + tools
grafel wizard               # create a group (interactive)
grafel install              # start daemon, register MCP, install skills
grafel status               # confirm MCP: connected
```

---

## Choosing which AI coding tools to target

`grafel install` writes MCP entries, rules files, and (for Claude Code) skills
into the AI coding tools you use. By default it targets **every supported
tool**. To pick a subset:

```sh
grafel install --tools claude,cursor,windsurf   # non-interactive allow-list
grafel install                                  # interactive wizard on a TTY
grafel install --no-wizard                       # keep current/default set; skip wizard
grafel tools list                                # inspect enabled/detected state
grafel tools enable kiro                          # enable a tool after install (in-process)
grafel tools disable codeium                       # disable a tool after install (in-process)
```

The same selection is editable from the dashboard under **Settings → AI coding
tools**.

See [tools.md](tools.md) for the full supported-tools matrix (exact MCP config
paths and rules-file paths per tool) and the complete enable/disable reference,
and [setup-per-tool.md](setup-per-tool.md) for step-by-step setup + verification
in each tool.

---

## Upgrade

```sh
grafel update               # fetch latest stable, atomic replace, re-run install
grafel update --pre         # latest pre-release
grafel update --tag v1.2.3  # pin a specific version
```

If the upgrade fails, the binary is automatically restored from the pre-update stash.

---

## Uninstall

```sh
grafel uninstall            # removes skills, MCP entries, stops daemon; leaves graphs
grafel uninstall --purge    # also removes ~/.grafel/store/ and docs/
```

Uninstall reads `install.json` to remove only what grafel owns — it will not touch other tools' MCP registrations.

## Configuration file

User preferences are persisted to `~/.grafel/settings.json`. See [settings.md](settings.md) for the full field reference.
