# Grammar setup audit (B3, epic #5359 — milestone 0.1.4)

_Audit date: 2026-06-23. Source-of-truth manifest: [`grammars.lock`](../grammars.lock)._

This is the foundational deliverable of epic #5359 (Part D step 1): inventory the
real tree-sitter grammar setup so we know what is stale before building the
freshness alarm (A1/A2) and doing the catch-up bump (B1).

## 1. The binding dependency

- **Dep:** `github.com/smacker/go-tree-sitter v0.0.0-20240827094217-dd81d9e9be82`
  (`go.mod` line 18).
- **Pinned commit `dd81d9e9be82` — date 2024-08-27** (~22 months stale at filing).
- **No `replace` directive, no fork.** The audit explicitly confirmed there is no
  `replace`-to-a-fork already freshening grammars. `go.mod` has zero `replace`
  directives.
- **CRITICAL FINDING — the binding is at upstream HEAD and unmaintained.**
  `gh api compare/dd81d9e9be82...master` on `smacker/go-tree-sitter` returns
  `ahead_by: 0, status: identical`. The pinned commit *is* the current HEAD of
  the upstream binding. There have been **no commits to smacker/go-tree-sitter
  since 2024-08-27** — the binding appears abandoned.

### Consequence for the freshness plan
- **A1 (Renovate/Dependabot on the dep) will find nothing newer** — the dep is
  already at its upstream HEAD. A1 is still worth wiring (cheap, catches the day
  the binding revives) but it is NOT the alarm.
- **A2 (per-grammar upstream tracking via `grammars.lock`) is the real alarm** —
  it tracks each `tree-sitter/tree-sitter-<lang>` independently of the dead binding.
- **B2 (decouple to the official binding) gains urgency.** The official
  `github.com/tree-sitter/go-tree-sitter` is alive: latest release **v0.24.0**,
  latest commit `c9492002f76e` (2025-11-12), with per-language grammar Go
  modules that Renovate can bump independently. This is the only path back to
  automated freshness.

## 2. Grammar-backed vs heuristic-only languages

Authoritative source: the `languageRegistry` in
`internal/treesitter/parser.go` (28 grammars loaded via smacker imports).

**Grammar-backed (28):** bash (alias shell), c, cpp, css, csharp, dockerfile,
elixir, go, groovy, hcl (alias terraform), html, java, javascript, kotlin, lua,
markdown, ocaml, php, proto, python, ruby, rust, scala, sql, swift, toml,
typescript (alias tsx), yaml.

**Heuristic-only (NO grammar dep — out of scope for freshness):** avro, cobol,
bicep, zig, astro, svelte, vue, elm, fish, jcl, jsonschema, just, bazel, lisp,
mage, razor, reasonml, config, task, sresolver. These have their own extractor
drift (noted in the epic for a separate pass). Note: the **markdown** extractor
is pure-stdlib even though a markdown grammar is loaded in the registry.

## 3. Per-grammar staleness (spot-check of the high-value four)

The smacker bundle vendors grammar C sources with **no per-grammar version
provenance** — only ABI `LANGUAGE_VERSION` numbers in each `parser.h`, not the
upstream grammar semver. So the bundled version is recorded as the binding
snapshot date (2024-08-27); upstream-latest is queried live. Full table in
`grammars.lock`.

| Language | Upstream repo | Bundled (smacker snapshot) | Upstream latest release | Upstream last commit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Java | tree-sitter/tree-sitter-java | 2024-08-27 | v0.23.5 | 2025-09-15 |
| C# | tree-sitter/tree-sitter-c-sharp | 2024-08-27 | v0.23.5 | 2026-06-02 |
| Python | tree-sitter/tree-sitter-python | 2024-08-27 | v0.25.0 | 2025-09-15 |
| TypeScript | tree-sitter/tree-sitter-typescript | 2024-08-27 | v0.23.2 | 2025-01-30 |

All four (and every grammar-backed language) have moved materially ahead of the
2024-08-27 snapshot. C3 backfill targets flagged in `grammars.lock`:
C# primary constructors + collection expressions, Java sealed types + record
patterns, Python 3.12+ PEP 695 type params, TS const type params.

## 4. A4 prerequisite — does `fidelity` already expose per-language parse errors?

**Partially — the per-parse signal exists but is NOT aggregated per language.**

- The `fidelity` metric (`internal/mcp/tools.go:2947`,
  `internal/mcp/docgen_repair_tools.go`) is an **IMPORTS-resolution** metric:
  `1 − (unresolved IMPORTS / total IMPORTS)`. It is **not** a parse-error-node
  rate. A4 cannot build on it directly.
- However, the parser **already computes a per-parse error-node ratio**:
  `ParseResult.ErrorRatio = error_nodes / total_nodes`
  (`internal/treesitter/parser.go:160-162, 246-250`, via `countNodes`). It is
  used today as a per-file fault-tolerance gate (`maxErrorRatio = 0.10`, files
  above are rejected) and emitted **only as an OTel span attribute**
  (`error_ratio` on the `treesitter.parse` span, `parser.go:256`).
- `ErrorRatio` is **not aggregated per language, not persisted to the graph, and
  not exposed in any metric/stats surface** (confirmed: no `ErrorRatio` reads
  outside `parser.go`).

**A4 verdict:** the raw per-parse signal is already there; A4's work is to
**aggregate `ErrorRatio` by language during indexing, persist a baseline, and
alert on per-language spikes** — not to compute error nodes from scratch, and
not to extend `fidelity` (different axis).

## 4a. A2 — the monthly freshness alarm (built)

The freshness alarm is live as a scheduled GitHub Action plus a small Go tool.

- **Checker:** `tools/grammar-freshness` (standalone, zero `internal/` imports).
  It reads `grammars.lock`, and for each grammar-backed language queries the
  upstream `source` repo's latest **release/tag** via the GitHub API, falling
  back to the **default-branch latest commit date** when a repo has no releases.
  It compares the upstream commit date to the bundled smacker snapshot
  (`2024-08-27`) and reports each grammar as `STALE`, `CURRENT`, or `UNKNOWN`
  (unreachable). Run it locally:

  ```sh
  GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token) go run ./tools/grammar-freshness            # human table
  GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token) go run ./tools/grammar-freshness -format markdown  # issue body
  ```

  It exits non-zero **only** on a hard error (unreadable manifest, or *every*
  upstream lookup failing). Finding stale grammars is reported, not a failure.
  It is rate-limit-aware (honours the reset header once) and resilient to
  individual repos being unreachable.

- **Workflow:** `.github/workflows/grammar-freshness.yml` runs on a **monthly
  cron** (06:00 UTC on the 1st) plus manual `workflow_dispatch`. It is *not*
  wired to push/PR to stay inside free-tier minutes (CI policy). With minimal
  permissions (`issues: write`, `contents: read`) it runs the checker and, if
  any grammar is stale, **creates or updates a single tracking issue** —
  identified idempotently by the stable label **`grammar-freshness`** (title
  fallback) — whose body is the checker's markdown table of stale grammars and
  the last-checked date. Re-runs edit the same issue rather than spamming new
  ones.

- **How to read the tracking issue:** the table lists every grammar whose
  upstream has moved ahead of the bundled snapshot, with the upstream latest
  release/commit and an approximate months-behind figure. Because the smacker
  binding is unmaintained, expect **most/all 28 grammars to show stale** — that
  is the intended signal motivating the B1 catch-up bump and the B2 decoupling.
  A dry run at audit time flagged **24 of 28** stale (the 4 current — lua,
  proto, toml, yaml — have upstreams that genuinely predate the snapshot).

- **`last_verified` refresh:** the manifest's `last_verified` / upstream-latest
  columns are refreshed manually when a maintainer reconciles the tracking issue
  (e.g. after a catch-up bump). The cron itself reports against the committed
  manifest and does not auto-commit, keeping the Action read-only on the repo.

## 5. Sequencing (Part D)

1. **B3 (this audit + `grammars.lock`)** ✓ + A1/A2 freshness alarm.
2. **B1** catch-up bump behind the fidelity/coverage benchmark.
3. **A3** calendar + **A4** parse-error canary.
4. **C1/C2** process; **C3** backfill for the catch-up window.
5. **B2** decoupling — assessment, may slip past 0.1.4.
