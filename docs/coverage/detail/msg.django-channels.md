## Capabilities

|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Room channel grouping | ✅ `full` | `2026-06-02` | 3628 | `internal/engine/ws_channel_grouping.go`<br>`internal/engine/ws_channel_grouping_test.go` | [realtime] Django Channels group grouping (#3628 child): applyWSChannelGrouping (python) emits JOINS_CHANNEL(method -> SCOPE.Channel:<group>) for channel_layer.group_add('chat', ...) (and group_discard) and BROADCASTS_TO(method -> SCOPE.Channel:<group>) for group_send('chat', ...) with LITERAL group names; group_add + group_send on the same group converge on one node. Anchored on the group_ call so it is independent of how the channel layer is reached. Honest-partial: dynamic group names skipped. |
