## Capabilities

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Config binding | 🔴 `missing` | — | 5782 | — | — |
| Consumer extraction | ✅ `full` | `2026-06-13` | — | `internal/custom/csharp/wolverine.go`<br>`internal/custom/csharp/wolverine_test.go` | #4995 (spun out of #4967): Wolverine has no marker interface — it routes by method convention, so the handler is any class with a Handle/Handles/Consume/Consumes method whose first parameter is the message type. The enclosing class -> SCOPE.Service(handler) CONSUMES with task_id wolverine:message:<T> so it converges with its PublishAsync/SendAsync/InvokeAsync producer by message contract. Proven by TestWolverinePublishHandlerConverge (asserts task_id convergence + edge_kind=CONSUMES) and TestWolverineConsumeConventionHandler. Honest-partial: the convention method is attributed to the nearest preceding class declaration (regex enclosing-scope, not AST), so deeply nested types are not disambiguated, and Handle methods with no explicit-typed first parameter are not parsed. |
| Producer extraction | ✅ `full` | `2026-06-13` | — | `internal/custom/csharp/wolverine.go`<br>`internal/custom/csharp/wolverine_test.go` | #4995: IMessageBus dispatch — bus.PublishAsync(new T{...}) -> SCOPE.Operation(publish), bus.SendAsync(new T{...}) -> SCOPE.Operation(send), bus.InvokeAsync<TResp>(new T{...}) -> SCOPE.Operation(invoke), each PRODUCES carrying message_type + task_id wolverine:message:<T>. A Wolverine signal gate (using Wolverine / IMessageBus / .PublishAsync / .InvokeAsync / .SendAsync) keeps the shared convention Handle/Consume verbs from being mis-attributed on non-Wolverine files (proven by TestWolverineSignalGate). Honest-partial: only 'new' literal dispatch is parsed; inline-var / generic PublishAsync<T>() with no literal, and AST receiver-type resolution, are not. |
| Topic attribution | 🟢 `partial` | — | 4995 | `internal/custom/csharp/wolverine.go`<br>`internal/custom/csharp/wolverine_test.go` | #4995: the message type is the topic — producer (publish/send/invoke) and convention handler all share task_id wolverine:message:<T> so they converge by contract (proven by TestWolverineAllEntitiesConverge). Honest-partial: the message contract class itself is not separately emitted as a SCOPE.Schema (Wolverine messages are plain POCOs, no marker interface), and transport/queue routing from endpoint config (PublishMessage<T>().ToRabbitExchange(...) etc.) is not yet recovered — tracked as a follow-up. |
