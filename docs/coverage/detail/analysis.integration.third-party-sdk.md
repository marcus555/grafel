| External service dependency | 🟢 `partial` | `2026-06-02` | 3628 | `internal/extractor/external_service.go`<br>`internal/extractor/external_service_test.go`<br>`internal/extractors/javascript/external_service.go`<br>`internal/extractors/javascript/external_service_test.go`<br>`internal/extractors/python/external_service.go`<br>`internal/extractors/python/external_service_test.go`<br>`internal/types/kinds.go` | #3628 area: SDK-LEVEL named third-party integration detection, distinct from raw HTTP-client CONSUMES_API (path-level). Each language extractor emits a DEPENDS_ON_SERVICE edge from the calling function/method to a synthetic SCOPE.ExternalService node (Name "service:<name>") so every call site of a service converges on ONE node and the graph answers "what third-party services does this codebase integrate with, and where?". The shared dictionary + node/edge builders live in internal/extractor/external_service.go (ServiceForImportSource, AWSServiceFromArg, ExternalServiceEntity, ExternalServiceTargetID, EmitServiceDependencyEdges). Service dictionary covers stripe, twilio, sendgrid, openai, slack, sentry, firebase, algolia, and the AWS family (aws-s3/ses/sns/sqs/dynamodb/lambda/cognito/... via boto3 client/resource literal arg or @aws-sdk v3 client class name; cognito folds boto3 cognito-idp/cognito-identity and the aws-sdk v3 CognitoIdentityProvider/CognitoIdentity client classes into one aws-cognito node). Python pass (internal/extractors/python/external_service.go): import-gated attribute-chain + from-import constructor detection; AWS service resolved from the boto3.client/resource string literal. JS/TS pass (internal/extractors/javascript/external_service.go): import-gated `new Stripe()` + local-var-back-reference (stripe.charges.create), default-import receiver (sgMail.send), namespace init (Sentry.init), @aws-sdk client-class -> aws-<svc>. Optional `operation` edge property records the SDK call. PRECISION-FIRST / honest-partial: a dynamic boto3 service string -> aws-generic; an unrecognised SDK or a bare .create()/.send() on a non-imported object emits NO edge. PARTIAL because only python + javascript/typescript lanes are implemented (java/go/ruby/php and the long tail of SDKs are future lanes), and recall within a lane is deliberately bounded to import-rooted shapes. DEPLOY-DEFERRED: extractor + kinds land here; live-daemon reindex is a separate coordinated step. |
