## Capabilities


### Models

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Model extraction | 🟢 `partial` | `2026-06-03` | 3098 | `internal/custom/java/neo4j.go`<br>`internal/custom/java/neo4j_test.go` | Cite corrected (#3637): custom_java_neo4j (neo4j.go) emits one SCOPE.Schema/node per Spring Data Neo4j @Node and Neo4j OGM @NodeEntity class (value-asserting TestNeo4jNodeEntityExtracted / TestNeo4jOGMNodeEntityExtracted). Partial: regex, same-file @Property/@Id only — full document-shape mapping not parsed. |
| Model lifecycle extraction | 🔴 `missing` | — | 3628 | — | — |
| Schema extraction | 🟢 `partial` | — | 3098 | `internal/custom/java/neo4j.go` | No Neo4j Java ORM extractor; @Node annotation for node entity extraction not implemented. |

### Relationships

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Association extraction | 🟢 `partial` | — | 3098 | `internal/custom/java/neo4j.go` | No Neo4j Java ORM extractor (Spring Data Neo4j @Node/@Relationship annotations not handled). Tracked in issue #3001. |
| Foreign key extraction | — `not_applicable` | — | 3098 | `internal/custom/java/neo4j.go` | Neo4j is a graph database with no foreign key concept; foreign_key_extraction is not applicable |
| Lazy loading recognition | — `not_applicable` | — | 3098 | `internal/custom/java/neo4j.go` | Neo4j Spring Data has no lazy-loading concept equivalent to relational ORMs; not applicable |
| Relationship extraction | ✅ `full` | — | 3611 | `internal/custom/java/neo4j.go`<br>`internal/custom/java/neo4j_test.go` | @Relationship(type=,direction=) fields are extracted AND emitted as traversable GRAPH_RELATES graph-schema edges owner-@Node -> target-@Node (mirrors JOINS_COLLECTION for graph DBs); the app's domain graph topology is now a navigable subgraph rather than opaque string props. Full for same-file @Node targets (value-asserting test TestNeo4jGraphRelatesEdge: Person -GRAPH_RELATES(ACTED_IN)-> Movie); cross-file target resolution is honest-partial (deferred to the resolver / future cross-file pass, kept as target_node props only). |

### Queries

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Query attribution | 🟢 `partial` | `2026-06-05` | [link](https://github.com/cajasmota/grafel/issues/3645) | `internal/engine/orm_queries.go`<br>`internal/engine/orm_queries_datastore_infra.go`<br>`internal/engine/orm_queries_datastore_infra_test.go` | Driver topology: the Java GraphDatabase/neo4j-java-driver `session.run("MATCH (n:Label) ...")` Cypher string (cypherRunRe, import-gated on mentionsNeo4jDriver) is captured via scanInfra->emitCypherTargets; the FIRST node label + CRUD verb parsed into a QUERIES edge to Class:<Label>. Partial: only the first label of a multi-label pattern is attributed and dynamic/parameterised labels are honest-skipped (#3645). |

### Migrations

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Migration parsing | — `not_applicable` | — | 3098 | `internal/custom/java/neo4j.go` | Neo4j graph database has no SQL migration files; migration_parsing is not applicable |
| Migration schema ops | 🔴 `missing` | — | 3628 | — | — |

### Transactions

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Transaction function stamping | 🔴 `missing` | — | 3628-transaction-function-stamping | — | — |
