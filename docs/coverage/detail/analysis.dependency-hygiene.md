## Capabilities

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Dependency usage status | ✅ `full` | `2026-06-02` | — | `cmd/grafel/index.go`<br>`internal/engine/dependency_hygiene.go`<br>`internal/engine/dependency_hygiene_test.go`<br>`internal/extractors/cross/deplinker/extractor.go` | deplinker used/unused/phantom classification is now PERSISTED into the graph (issue #3640, epic #3625). The Pass 8.7 engine pass engine.ApplyDependencyHygiene reuses deplinker.Analyze over the assembled graph.Document and writes usage_status=used|unused onto each external_dependency entity (manifest extractor) and its DEPENDS_ON(kind=external_dependency) edge, so find/neighbors/agents read dependency hygiene directly. Phantom imports (imported, not declared) are reported as a stat but not synthesised as entities to avoid double-counting the manifest inventory; phantom listing remains the dashboard's job. The dashboard handler keeps calling AnalyzeGroup independently (no double-emit). Honest-partial: classification fidelity tracks deplinker's manifest+import inputs. |
