|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Model extraction | — `not_applicable` | — | — | — | — |
| Model lifecycle extraction | 🔴 `missing` | — | 3628 | — | — |

### Relationships

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Association extraction | — `not_applicable` | `2026-05-29` | — | — | Raw database/sql driver: archigraph models SQL query effects, not an ORM object-relationship graph. Relationship/foreign-key/association/lazy-loading are ORM-mapper concepts with no surface in a bare driver (consistent with sqlite/pgx/sqlx/mongodb sibling drivers). |
| Foreign key extraction | — `not_applicable` | `2026-05-29` | — | — | Raw database/sql driver: archigraph models SQL query effects, not an ORM object-relationship graph. Relationship/foreign-key/association/lazy-loading are ORM-mapper concepts with no surface in a bare driver (consistent with sqlite/pgx/sqlx/mongodb sibling drivers). |
| Lazy loading recognition | — `not_applicable` | `2026-05-29` | — | — | Raw database/sql driver: archigraph models SQL query effects, not an ORM object-relationship graph. Relationship/foreign-key/association/lazy-loading are ORM-mapper concepts with no surface in a bare driver (consistent with sqlite/pgx/sqlx/mongodb sibling drivers). |

| Query attribution | ✅ `full` | `2026-06-02` | — | `internal/extractors/cross/dbmap/extractor_test.go`<br>`internal/extractors/cross/dbmap/orms.go` | Raw db.Query/Exec("…") SQL resolves table topology: dbmap.detectGoSQLDriver (import-gated on github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql, lib/pq, go-sqlite3, jackc/pgx, jmoiron/sqlx) parses FROM/INTO/UPDATE/JOIN and emits SCOPE.DataAccess + ACCESSES_TABLE edges with read/write verb. Value-asserting tests TestGoSQLDriverLibPQSelect + TestGoSQLDriverNoDoubleEmitWithDatabaseSQL (#3644). |
