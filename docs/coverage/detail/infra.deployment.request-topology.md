## Capabilities

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Dependency attribution | ✅ `full` | `2026-06-02` | — | `internal/classifier/classifier.go`<br>`internal/engine/deployment_topology_edges.go`<br>`internal/engine/deployment_topology_edges_test.go` | #3633 (epic #3625): restored the previously-orphaned deployment_topology enricher as a LIVE engine pass (applyDeploymentTopologyEdges, registered in detector.go after the IaC/serverless passes). Models the proxy/gateway request-flow that was invisible in the graph: nginx `proxy_pass http://<name>` matched to an `upstream <name>` block -> gateway DEPENDS_ON service:<name> (a bare-host proxy_pass -> ROUTES_TO); Caddy `reverse_proxy <host:port>` -> gateway ROUTES_TO service:<host>; docker-compose `<svc> depends_on <dep>` (both short list + long mapping form) -> service:<svc> DEPENDS_ON service:<dep>; Kong declarative service-with-routes -> gateway ROUTES_TO service:<name>; Traefik dynamic router.service -> gateway ROUTES_TO service:<name>. Backend services keyed `service:<name>` so a proxy upstream and a compose service collapse onto one SCOPE.Service node. nginx.conf/Caddyfile/.nginx classified (no extractor needed; classified files still reach the Pass 2.5 detector). K8s Ingress->Service and serverless.yml topology are owned by infra.container.kubernetes / the serverless cell. Value-asserting tests assert each specific edge; honest-partial: dynamic/templated targets ({...}/${...}) are omitted, not guessed. |
| Resource extraction | 🟢 `partial` | `2026-06-02` | — | `internal/engine/deployment_topology_edges.go`<br>`internal/engine/deployment_topology_edges_test.go` | #3633: mints SCOPE.Service nodes for the proxy/gateway layer (one per config, role=gateway) and for every backend it routes to (role=backend) plus docker-compose services (role=compose_service). Partial because only the request-flow-relevant fields are extracted (service identity + dependency targets), not full per-resource config (ports/volumes/networks remain with the docker ruleset / yaml extractor). |
