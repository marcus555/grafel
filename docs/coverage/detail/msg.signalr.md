## Capabilities

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Consumer extraction | 🔴 `missing` | — | 3682 | — | Client-side SignalR (HubConnectionBuilder().WithUrl) extraction not yet implemented; producer-side endpoints land in #3682. |
| Producer extraction | ✅ `full` | `2026-06-02` | — | `internal/engine/realtime_endpoint_synthesis.go`<br>`internal/engine/realtime_endpoint_synthesis_test.go` | #3682 (epic #3628 area #7): SignalR Hubs emit endpoint-shaped http_endpoint_definition entities. Each client-invokable public Task/void method on a 'class XHub : Hub' becomes a realtime endpoint http:WS:<base>/<Method> (transport=signalr) with a HANDLES edge Class:Hub.Method -> endpoint; app.MapHub<XHub>("/path") rebinds the base path, else default /<hub-without-suffix>. Lifecycle overrides (OnConnectedAsync/OnDisconnectedAsync/Dispose) excluded. Honest: hub method discovery is regex-scoped to the class body; no cross-assembly client-invoke verification. |
