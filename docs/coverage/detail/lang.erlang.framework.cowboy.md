## Capabilities


### Routing

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Endpoint deprecation versioning | 🔴 `missing` | — | 4749 | — | — |
| Endpoint pagination posture | 🔴 `missing` | — | 4749 | — | — |
| Endpoint response codes | 🔴 `missing` | — | 4749 | — | — |
| Endpoint synthesis | ✅ `full` | `2026-06-11` | — | `internal/engine/elixir_routes.go`<br>`internal/engine/http_endpoint_erlang_test.go`<br>`internal/engine/http_endpoint_synthesis.go`<br>`internal/engine/httproutes/canonicalize.go` | #4749 (epic #4615 tail): Erlang Cowboy dispatch tables (cowboy_router:compile([{'_', [{"/users/:id", user_handler, []}]}])) in .erl files synthesise canonical http_endpoint_definition entities. The shared synthesizeCowboy producer (internal/engine/elixir_routes.go), previously reached only for case "elixir", is now wired for case "erlang" in applyHTTPEndpointSynthesis and erlang is allowed through synthesisSupportsLanguage. Colon path params (:id) canonicalised to {id} via FrameworkCowboy. Cowboy encodes the verb in the handler's init/2 (not the dispatch table) so an ANY endpoint is emitted per route. Proven by TestErlang_CowboyDispatch. |
| Handler attribution | 🟢 `partial` | — | 4749 | `internal/engine/elixir_routes.go`<br>`internal/engine/http_endpoint_erlang_test.go` | Cowboy dispatch route carries the handler module atom (user_handler), stamped as source_handler, but Cowboy verb dispatch happens inside the handler's init/2 + cowboy_req:method — no per-verb handler function is named in the dispatch table, so no endpoint->handler IMPLEMENTS bridge to a specific operation is emitted (ANY endpoint attributed to the module). Honest partial. |
| Route extraction | ✅ `full` | `2026-06-11` | — | `internal/engine/elixir_routes.go`<br>`internal/engine/http_endpoint_erlang_test.go`<br>`internal/engine/http_endpoint_synthesis.go`<br>`internal/engine/httproutes/canonicalize.go` | #4749 (epic #4615 tail): synthesizeCowboy extracts literal {"/path", Handler, _} dispatch-table triples from Erlang cowboy_router:compile(...) lists (gated on a cowboy_router signal). Host wildcard '_' and non-/ strings skipped; :id folded to {id}. Proven by TestErlang_CowboyDispatch + TestErlang_NonCowboyTupleIgnored (negative guard). |
| Websocket route extraction | 🔴 `missing` | `2026-06-14` | — | — | #4965: dedicated websocket_route_extraction not yet implemented for this framework. The capability key was introduced for the rust axum/actix/warp WS extractor (internal/custom/rust/websocket_routes.go); this framework's WebSocket-upgrade idiom is not yet recognised and is a follow-up gap. |

### Testing

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Tests linkage | 🟢 `partial` | — | 4749 | `internal/custom/erlang/tests_route_e2e.go`<br>`internal/engine/elixir_routes.go`<br>`internal/engine/http_endpoint_e2e_testmap.go`<br>`internal/engine/http_endpoint_e2e_testmap_4749_erlang_test.go` | Test->endpoint route-hit linkage (#4749, slice of all-framework #4615). Erlang is FUNCTIONAL / process-based (no OO receiver objects) so local-variable/receiver typing (#4680/#4681) is N/A — a Cowboy handler is dispatched by the literal route path on the request, not by an obj.method() receiver; route-string linkage is the coverage mechanism (mirrors functional Elixir #4688 / Clojure #4749). custom_erlang_tests_route_e2e (internal/custom/erlang/tests_route_e2e.go) emits one test_suite per eunit/common_test file (*_tests.erl, *_SUITE.erl, or /test/ dir) carrying e2e_route_calls (VERB+route) for httpc:request(get, {"http://host/path", []}, ...), the bare httpc:request("url") GET form, gun:get(Conn, "/path"), and hackney:get(<<"url">>, ...) / hackney:request(verb, ...) route hits; the language-agnostic engine.linkE2ERouteTestsToEndpoints pass (#4351/#4369) matches each pair to the http_endpoint_definition synthesised by synthesizeCowboy and emits the TESTS edge. Proven RED->GREEN in http_endpoint_e2e_testmap_4749_erlang_test.go (httpc GET+POST -> ANY /todos + gun path-param). Test scope: name_test()/name_test_() (eunit) and case(Config) (common_test) are named fns already mined; route hits live inside their bodies so the suite is keyed per-file (one suite/file, like Jest/ExUnit/clojure.test) — Erlang test blocks are named function clauses not closures, so no synthetic anonymous-block scope-owner is needed. PARTIAL (honest): eunit/CT commonly spin a test server on an ephemeral port and BUILD the URL by ++ concatenation (httpc:request(get, {"http://localhost:" ++ integer_to_list(Port) ++ "/users", []}, ...)) — these non-literal paths are NOT statically recoverable and are dropped (proven by TestErlang_BuiltURLExcluded); only fully-literal-path hits link. ++-built-URL recovery is the documented follow-up. |
