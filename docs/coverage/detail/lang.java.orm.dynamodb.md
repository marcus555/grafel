## Capabilities


### Models

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Model extraction | ✅ `full` | `2026-05-29` | 3099 | `internal/custom/java/dynamodb_java.go`<br>`internal/engine/rules/java/orms/dynamodb_java.yaml` | custom_java_dynamodb extractor emits SCOPE.Schema/model for @DynamoDbBean classes; YAML rule gates on Enhanced Client imports. |
| Model lifecycle extraction | 🔴 `missing` | — | 3628 | — | — |
| Schema extraction | 🟢 `partial` | `2026-05-29` | 3099 | `internal/custom/java/dynamodb_java.go` | Detects @DynamoDbBean/@DynamoDbPartitionKey/@DynamoDbSortKey/@DynamoDbAttribute for schema attributes; model and query covered by existing YAML rule. |

### Relationships

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Association extraction | — `not_applicable` | — | 3099 | — | DynamoDB is a key-value/document store with no relational ORM associations; this concept does not apply. |
| Foreign key extraction | — `not_applicable` | — | 3099 | — | DynamoDB has no foreign keys; relational FK concepts are not applicable to a key-value store. |
| Lazy loading recognition | — `not_applicable` | — | 3099 | — | DynamoDB Enhanced Client has no lazy-loading concept; items are fetched by key, not via ORM proxies. |
| Relationship extraction | — `not_applicable` | — | 3099 | — | DynamoDB uses single-table design or application-level denormalization; no ORM relationship annotations exist. |

### Queries

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Query attribution | ✅ `full` | `2026-05-29` | 3099 | `internal/engine/rules/java/orms/dynamodb_java.yaml` | YAML rule covers DynamoDbEnhancedClient scan/query operations; query_attribution fully covered by existing rule. |

### Migrations
