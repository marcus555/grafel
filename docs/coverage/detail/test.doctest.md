## Capabilities

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Dependency graph | — `not_applicable` | — | 3078 | — | — |
| Target extraction | 🔴 `missing` | — | 3078 | — | ApplyDoctestTargets removed (#3655): it was never wired into cmd/grafel/index.go's applyPass list, so it emitted zero edges in production. Its edges were also test-entity self-loops (FromID==ToID), which ComputeCoverage discards because the ToID is not a production entity. Doctest tests-via-docstring is not yet extracted. |
