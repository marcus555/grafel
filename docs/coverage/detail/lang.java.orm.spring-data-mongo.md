## Capabilities


### Models

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Model extraction | 🔴 `missing` | `2026-06-02` | [link](https://github.com/cajasmota/archigraph/issues/3645) | — | YAML detection-only; dead custom_extractor never ran in Go; no native query-topology extractor. |
| Model lifecycle extraction | 🔴 `missing` | — | 3628 | — | — |
| Schema extraction | 🔴 `missing` | `2026-05-29` | [link](https://github.com/cajasmota/archigraph/issues/3586) | `internal/custom/java/extractors_test.go`<br>`internal/custom/java/spring_ecosystem.go` | — |

### Relationships

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Association extraction | — `not_applicable` | — | 3095 | — | NoSQL store has no relational join/FK/lazy-load concept; not_applicable by design. |
| Foreign key extraction | — `not_applicable` | — | 3095 | — | NoSQL store has no relational join/FK/lazy-load concept; not_applicable by design. |
| Lazy loading recognition | — `not_applicable` | — | 3095 | — | NoSQL store has no relational join/FK/lazy-load concept; not_applicable by design. |
| Relationship extraction | — `not_applicable` | — | 3095 | — | NoSQL store has no relational join/FK/lazy-load concept; not_applicable by design. |

### Queries

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Query attribution | 🟢 `partial` | `2026-06-02` | [link](https://github.com/cajasmota/archigraph/issues/3645) | `internal/engine/orm_queries.go`<br>`internal/engine/orm_queries_java_mongo_agg.go`<br>`internal/engine/orm_queries_java_mongo_agg_test.go` | Spring Data MongoDB aggregation $lookup joins now extracted (scanJavaSpringMongoAggregation, #3845): each $lookup emits a JOINS_COLLECTION edge aggregating-collection -> from collection (Class:Book -> Class:Author) plus a SCOPE.DataAccess stage entity, matching the Python/Mongoose contract. Three idioms: fluent LookupOperation.newLookup().from(..).localField(..).foreignField(..).as(..); positional Aggregation.lookup(from,lf,ff,as); and @Aggregation(pipeline={"{ $lookup: { from: 'authors' } }"}) string pipelines (fed to the shared JSON stage splitter). Aggregating collection resolved from mongoTemplate.aggregate(agg, "books"|Book.class, ..), same-file @Document(..), or the MongoRepository<Entity,..> generic. Honest-partial: dynamic .from(var)/dynamic collection -> no edge; general query attribution + model topology still missing. |

### Migrations

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Migration parsing | — `not_applicable` | `2026-05-29` | — | — | ORM model-definition layer; database migration files are owned by Flyway/Liquibase, not the ORM itself. Same rationale as lang.java.orm.jooq and lang.java.orm.neo4j N/A. |
| Migration schema ops | 🔴 `missing` | — | 3628 | — | — |

### Transactions

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Transaction function stamping | 🔴 `missing` | — | 3628-transaction-function-stamping | — | — |

## Datastore

This driver/ORM record provides code-level coverage for the
[`db.mongodb`](./db.mongodb.md) infra record (MongoDB (collections)),
which tracks datastore-level extraction for the same technology.

## Provenance

This record is sourced from `docs/coverage/registry.json`. To update it, edit the JSON
(or use `go run ./tools/coverage update lang.java.orm.spring-data-mongo ...`) then regenerate:

```
go run ./tools/coverage validate
go run ./tools/coverage gen
```
