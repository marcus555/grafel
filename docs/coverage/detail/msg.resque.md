## Capabilities

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Consumer extraction | 🟢 `partial` | — | 3628 | `internal/engine/scheduled_jobs_edges.go`<br>`internal/engine/scheduled_jobs_edges_test.go` | epic #3628 jobs cross-link: a Ruby class declaring @queue = :name AND def self.perform becomes a SCOPE.ScheduledJob (resque:<Job>) with a TRIGGERS edge to perform (the consumer). Honest-partial: requires both @queue and self.perform in one file; dynamic class refs not resolved. |
| Producer extraction | 🟢 `partial` | — | 3628 | `internal/engine/scheduled_jobs_edges.go`<br>`internal/engine/scheduled_jobs_edges_test.go` | epic #3628 jobs cross-link: Resque.enqueue/enqueue_to/enqueue_in dispatch sites emit an ENQUEUES edge from the enclosing Ruby method to the job entity (SCOPE.ScheduledJob resque:<Job>), joined on the shared resque:<Job> id with the consumer side. Honest-partial: enqueue target resolves only when the job class def is in the indexed group; dynamic class names not resolved. |
| Topic attribution | 🟢 `partial` | — | 3628 | `internal/engine/scheduled_jobs_edges.go`<br>`internal/engine/scheduled_jobs_edges_test.go` | epic #3628 jobs cross-link: producer ENQUEUES and consumer TRIGGERS both reference the same resque:<Job> SCOPE.ScheduledJob node, so a Resque.enqueue(Job) caller and the Job's self.perform join on one node (same shape as Sidekiq). Honest-partial: cross-file join requires the job class def to be indexed. |
