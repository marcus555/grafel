## Capabilities

|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Consumer extraction | 🟢 `partial` | — | 3628 | `internal/engine/scheduled_jobs_edges.go`<br>`internal/engine/scheduled_jobs_edges_test.go` | #3628 area: every <interval> do runner/rake/command '...' end blocks in config/schedule.rb emit a SCOPE.ScheduledJob (whenever:<path>:<schedule>) carrying the interval/cron as schedule and a TRIGGERS edge to the first runner/rake/command descriptor. Honest-partial: only config/schedule.rb files are scanned; multi-line job bodies use the first descriptor as handler proxy. |
