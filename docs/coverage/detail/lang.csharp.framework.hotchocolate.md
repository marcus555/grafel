## Capabilities


### Routing

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Endpoint deprecation versioning | 🔴 `missing` | — | 3628 | — | — |
| Endpoint pagination posture | 🔴 `missing` | `2026-06-02` | 3628 | `internal/engine/http_endpoint_pagination.go`<br>`internal/engine/http_endpoint_pagination_patterns.go`<br>`internal/engine/http_endpoint_pagination_test.go`<br>`internal/engine/http_endpoint_synthesis.go` | #3628: applyEndpointPagination stamps paginated/pagination_style/pagination_params via the cross-language parameters/parameter_schema fallback (limit+offset/page/cursor shape). No framework-specific pagination-class/ORM signal yet for this framework. |
| Endpoint response codes | 🔴 `missing` | — | 3818 | — | — |
| Endpoint synthesis | ✅ `full` | `2026-06-02` | 3617 | `internal/engine/http_endpoint_hotchocolate.go`<br>`internal/engine/http_endpoint_hotchocolate_test.go` | synthesizeHotChocolate emits http:GRAPHQL:/graphql/<Query|Mutation|Subscription>/<field> per public resolver method — EXACT canonical shape as gqlgen (Go) / Strawberry (Python) / Apollo (JS) / Absinthe so client links (#3667) + cross-repo linker join. Field name = HotChocolate default: leading Get stripped + first letter lower-cased (GetUser->user, GetUsersByTeam->usersByTeam, CreateUser->createUser). Recognises [QueryType]/[MutationType]/[SubscriptionType] markers, [ExtendObjectType(typeof(Query))] extensions, and same-file fluent .AddQueryType<T>() registrations. Value-asserting tests assert the EXACT endpoint ids. |
| Handler attribution | ✅ `full` | `2026-06-02` | 3617 | `internal/engine/http_endpoint_hotchocolate.go`<br>`internal/engine/http_endpoint_hotchocolate_test.go` | Each endpoint carries source_handler=SCOPE.Operation:<Class>.<Method> (same naming as the C# extractor buildOperation), which ResolveHTTPEndpointHandlers rebinds to the resolver method — HANDLES edge endpoint->method. Value-asserting tests assert source_handler=SCOPE.Operation:Query.GetUser / Mutation.CreateUser / UserQueries.GetUserByEmail. |
| Route extraction | 🟢 `partial` | `2026-06-02` | 3617 | `internal/engine/http_endpoint_hotchocolate.go`<br>`internal/engine/http_endpoint_hotchocolate_test.go` | Root-type registration recovered from marker attributes, [ExtendObjectType] extensions, or SAME-FILE fluent .AddQueryType<T>(). PARTIAL (honest): a resolver class registered fluently in a DIFFERENT file than its declaration, descriptor.Field() runtime fluent field definitions, and SDL schema-first .graphqls binding are not resolved. |

### Auth

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Auth coverage | ✅ `full` | `2026-06-02` | 3961 | `internal/custom/csharp/auth.go`<br>`internal/engine/http_endpoint_hotchocolate_auth.go`<br>`internal/engine/http_endpoint_hotchocolate_auth_test.go`<br>`internal/engine/http_endpoint_jsts_auth.go`<br>`internal/mcp/auth_coverage.go` | #3961: applyHotChocolateAuthShapes stamps [Authorize]/[Authorize(Roles=...)]/[Authorize(Policy=...)]/[AllowAnonymous] from each HotChocolate resolver method (and inherited type-level [Authorize]) onto its http:GRAPHQL: endpoint via the shared stampAuthPolicy contract — auth_required + auth_roles + auth_permissions + auth_policy, plus signal-1 auth_decorator so archigraph_auth_coverage fires. [AllowAnonymous] overrides class-level Authorize to explicit-public. Value-asserting tests assert the verdict on the specific resolver endpoint + negative (undecorated/no-signal) cases. |

### Validation

### Middleware

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Middleware coverage | 🔴 `missing` | — | backfill:dictionary-completeness | — | — |
| Rate limit stamping | 🟢 `partial` | — | [link](https://github.com/cajasmota/archigraph/issues/4089) | `internal/custom/csharp/rate_limit_endpoint.go`<br>`internal/custom/csharp/rate_limit_endpoint_test.go` | #4089: .NET RateLimiter binding `.MapGet(...).RequireRateLimiting("p")` (minimal API) and `[EnableRateLimiting("p")]` (controller/action) stamp rate_limited/rate_limit_scope=route/rate_limit_name=p on a SCOPE.Pattern/rate_limit marker. When policy `p` is defined in-file via AddFixedWindow/SlidingWindow/TokenBucket/ConcurrencyLimiter, rate_limit_source resolves the limiter kind and rate="<PermitLimit|TokenLimit>/<TimeSpan window>s" (PermitLimit=100,Window=FromMinutes(1) -> "100/60s"); a concurrency limiter resolves the kind but has no window (rate honest-partial). AspNetCoreRateLimit app.UseIp/ClientRateLimiting() stamps an engine-scope marker (limits live in appsettings -> rate omitted). Negatives: [DisableRateLimiting] suppresses an adjacent binding; AllowAnonymous/plain endpoints are not stamped. Partial: a cross-file policy is rate_limited with rate + limiter-kind omitted (honest-partial). |

### Schema

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Type graph extraction | 🔴 `missing` | — | 3804 | — | GraphQL object-type→type graph applies (this is a GraphQL server) but is not yet implemented for this framework/language; SDL servers are covered by internal/extractors/graphql/type_graph.go (#3805) and the TS/Python code-first set (TypeGraphQL/Nexus/Pothos/Strawberry/graphene) by the code-first type-graph extractors. This lane is the remaining backfill for other-language GraphQL frameworks. |

Honest-partial: dynamic keys + non-FeatureManager .IsEnabled miss (no literal / wrong receiver). |
