## Capabilities


### Models

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Model extraction | — `not_applicable` | — | — | — | — |
| Model lifecycle extraction | 🔴 `missing` | — | 3628 | — | — |
| Schema extraction | 🟢 `partial` | `2026-06-02` | 3614 | `internal/custom/ruby/neo4j_activegraph.go`<br>`internal/custom/ruby/neo4j_activegraph_test.go` | activegraph / neo4j.rb OGM (not just the raw driver): each class that includes ActiveGraph::Node (or legacy Neo4j::ActiveNode) is extracted as a SCOPE.Schema/node (the graph node label) and each `property :name` declaration as a SCOPE.Schema/property. Regex over class bodies; partial (no inheritance/mixin node resolution). |

### Relationships

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Association extraction | 🟢 `partial` | — | 3614 | `internal/custom/ruby/neo4j_activegraph.go` | activegraph has_many / has_one :out|:in associations are extracted as SCOPE.Component/relationship entities carrying relation_type, direction, and target_node (model_class). |
| Foreign key extraction | — `not_applicable` | — | — | — | graph DB — no foreign-key concept |
| Lazy loading recognition | — `not_applicable` | — | — | — | graph DB — no lazy-loading concept |
| Relationship extraction | ✅ `full` | `2026-06-02` | 3614 | `internal/custom/ruby/neo4j_activegraph.go`<br>`internal/custom/ruby/neo4j_activegraph_test.go` | activegraph has_many/has_one(:out|:in, type:, model_class:) associations are extracted AND emitted as traversable GRAPH_RELATES graph-schema edges owner-node -> target-node (mirrors the Python neomodel template #3670 / Java SDN #3663 / JOINS_COLLECTION for graph DBs); the domain graph topology is a navigable subgraph rather than opaque string props. Full for same-file ActiveGraph::Node targets (value-asserting test TestActiveGraphGraphRelatesEdge: Person -GRAPH_RELATES(ACTED_IN,OUTGOING)-> Movie; has_one :in -> INCOMING). Cross-file / dynamic model_class targets are honest-partial (kept as target_node props only). Reverses the #3635 datastore-pass downgrade for this OGM. |

### Queries

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Query attribution | ✅ `full` | `2026-06-04` | [link](https://github.com/cajasmota/grafel/issues/3645) | `internal/engine/orm_queries_datastore_infra.go`<br>`internal/engine/orm_queries_drivers_other_test.go` | Driver topology: the language-agnostic datastore-infra pass (scanDatastoreInfraDrivers → emitCypherTargets), already run for Ruby in applyORMQueries, attributes neo4j-ruby-driver `session.run("MATCH (u:User) ...")` Cypher to the node label — the SAME canonical QUERIES edge to Class:<Label> as the JS Neo4j pass. Verified by value-asserting test TestDriver_RubyNeo4jCypher: Function:find_users -find-> Class:User (orm=neo4j). Dynamic/parameterised labels honest-skipped. Credits the already-firing cross-language Cypher emitter for the Ruby driver. |

### Migrations
