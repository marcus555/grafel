Wired into applyHTTPEndpointSynthesis at http_endpoint_synthesis.go (the F# producer-side branch, gated by giraffeHasRoute so arbitrary F# files are skipped). Proven by TestGiraffe_BasicRoute / _RoutefTypedParam / _SaturnRouter / _CanonicalizeFormat / _InterpolatedRouteDropped / _NonWebFileIgnored. subRoute/forward mount-prefix folding + routeStartsWith/routex are handled as of #4940 (see route_extraction); the only honest exclusion is interpolated/variable paths. #5114: endpoint_synthesis now spans Oxpecker/Falco/Suave/minimal-API (F#) too (see route_extraction); same emit path + FrameworkGiraffe canonicalisation, proven by TestFSharp5114_Oxpecker/_Falco/_Suave/_MinimalApi. |
| Handler attribution | ✅ `full` | `2026-06-12` | 4940 | `internal/custom/fsharp/tests_route_e2e.go`<br>`internal/engine/http_endpoint_giraffe.go`<br>`internal/engine/http_endpoint_synthesis.go` | #4940 (was partial under #4906): the prior route-string test linkage is RETAINED, AND synthesizeGiraffeRoutes now captures the trailing same-file handler symbol of a route — Giraffe `route "/users" >=> listUsers` (giraffeRouteRe group 4, bare ident only) and Saturn `get "/users" listUsers` (saturnRouteRe group 3) — passing it as refName so the shared synthesis-time structural bridge (synthesisHandlerStructuralRef, #4319) emits an endpoint->handler IMPLEMENTS edge bound to the resolved `let`-bound HttpHandler by (file,name). Proven by TestGiraffe_NamedHandlerImplements / _SaturnNamedHandlerImplements (assert a `http_endpoint_synthesis_time_bridge` IMPLEMENTS edge for GET /users). Honest: a COMPOSED handler (a further `>=>` chain), a lambda, or a dotted/qualified name yields no captured symbol — the endpoint still emits, just without the named bridge (no fabricated edge). |
| Route extraction | ✅ `full` | `2026-06-12` | 5114 | `internal/engine/http_endpoint_giraffe.go`<br>`internal/engine/http_endpoint_giraffe_test.go` | #4940 (was partial under #4906): static Giraffe `route`/`routef`/`routeCi`/`routeStartsWith`/`routex` and Saturn `get/post/put/delete/...`(+f) verb+path registrations are recovered by synthesizeGiraffeRoutes. NEW in #4940: (1) `subRoute "/api" (...)` / `forward "/api" (...)` mount prefixes ARE now folded into nested child routes via balanced-paren span tracking (collectGiraffeMounts/matchCloseParen/prefixAt) — nesting composes left-to-right (`subRoute "/api" (subRoute "/v1" ...)` -> `/api/v1/...`), proven by TestGiraffe_SubRouteFolding / _ForwardFolding; (2) `routeStartsWith "/api"` emits as a literal prefix path and `routex "/users/(\d+)"` regex bodies canonicalise to the positional `{}` wildcard (canonicalizeRoutex), proven by TestGiraffe_RouteStartsWithAndRoutex. Honest exclusion (retained): interpolated / variable paths (`route basePath`, `$"{x}"`) and interpolated/variable subRoute/forward mount prefixes are dropped (only string-literal paths/prefixes emit, proven by TestGiraffe_InterpolatedRouteDropped). #5114 (non-db tail of #4941): synthesizeGiraffeRoutes now ALSO recovers the remaining F# web frameworks alongside Giraffe/Saturn — Oxpecker (Giraffe-compatible `GET >=> route`/`routef`, rides giraffeRouteRe), Falco (`mapGet "/x" h` register helpers via falcoMapRe; the bare `get "/x" h` form rides saturnRouteRe), Suave (`GET >=> path`/`pathScan "/x/%d"` via suaveRouteRe), and ASP.NET minimal-API in F# (`app.MapGet("/x", h)` via fsharpMinimalApiRe, with `{id}` curly params pre-canonicalised to `{}` by canonicalizeMinimalApiCurly). Proven by TestFSharp5114_Oxpecker/_Falco/_Suave/_MinimalApi + _NonWebFileIgnored/_WrongLanguageNoOp. |

### Type System

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Enum extraction | 🟢 `partial` | `2026-06-12` | 4906 | `internal/extractors/fsharp/extractor.go`<br>`internal/extractors/fsharp/fsharp_test.go` | #4906: the F# enum analog is the discriminated union — classifyTypeSubtype emits SCOPE.Component subtype=discriminated_union for `type T = A | B | C` (`= |` / body-leading `|`), proven by TestFSharp_TypeSubtypes. Partial: the DU CASES (A/B/C) are not emitted as individual entities, and a CLI-style `enum` (`type T = | A = 0`) is not distinguished from a DU. Case-level extraction is a follow-up. |
| Interface extraction | 🟢 `partial` | `2026-06-12` | 4906 | `internal/extractors/fsharp/extractor.go`<br>`internal/extractors/fsharp/fsharp_test.go` | #4906: classifyTypeSubtype emits SCOPE.Component subtype=interface for `type T = interface ... end` (and class/struct for those bodies), proven by TestFSharp_TypeSubtypes. Partial: abstract-member surfaces and interface-IMPLEMENTS edges are not yet modelled. |
| Type alias extraction | 🟢 `partial` | `2026-06-12` | 4906 | `internal/extractors/fsharp/extractor.go` | #4906: a `type Foo = Bar` alias is emitted as a SCOPE.Component (subtype per classifyTypeSubtype). Partial-honest: a pure alias falls through to the default 'type' subtype (no distinct 'alias' subtype), so alias-vs-nominal-type is not yet distinguished — a follow-up. |
| Type extraction | 🟢 `partial` | `2026-06-12` | 4906 | `internal/extractors/fsharp/extractor.go`<br>`internal/extractors/fsharp/fsharp_test.go` | #4906 (was wrongly 'missing'): typeRE emits every F# `type T = ...` declaration as a SCOPE.Component, with classifyTypeSubtype distinguishing record (`= {`) / discriminated_union (`= |`) / interface / class / struct, and a type CONTAINS its more-indented members. Proven by TestFSharp_TypeDiscovery + TestFSharp_TypeSubtypes. Partial: record fields / DU cases are not emitted as sub-entities and generic type-param constraints are not modelled. |

### Testing

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Tests linkage | ✅ `full` | `2026-06-11` | — | `internal/custom/fsharp/tests_route_e2e.go`<br>`internal/engine/http_endpoint_giraffe.go`<br>`internal/engine/httproutes/canonicalize.go` | Test->endpoint route-hit linkage (#4749, F# slice of tail epic; mirrors Crystal/Kemal #4760 and Swift/Vapor #4755): http_endpoint_giraffe.go synthesizes canonical http_endpoint_definition entities from F# web route registrations — Giraffe `GET >=> route "/users" >=> handler` / `routef "/users/%i"` combinator chains (inside `choose [ ... ]`) and Saturn `router { get "/users/:id" handler }` blocks — with FrameworkGiraffe canonicalisation that rewrites Giraffe routef printf placeholders (%i/%s/%O/...) to the positional `{}` wildcard and handles Saturn `:name` colon params. custom/fsharp/tests_route_e2e.go emits one test_suite per F# test file carrying e2e_route_calls from ASP.NET Core TestServer HttpClient verb helpers (client.GetAsync("/path") / PostAsync / ... and HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.X, "/path")); the shared language-agnostic engine.linkE2ERouteTestsToEndpoints pass then emits the TESTS edge to the exercised endpoint (proven by TestGiraffe_E2ERouteTestLinkage + TestGiraffe_BasicRoute/_RoutefTypedParam/_SaturnRouter + TestFSharpRouteE2E_*). F# test DSLs use anonymous closure blocks (Expecto `testCase "..." <| fun _ -> ...` / `testList`; xUnit `[<Fact>]`), so the test_suite is the scope-owner carrying the route hits (F# analog of Ruby #4684 / JS #4680 / Crystal #4760). Local-variable/receiver typing (#4749 part a) is N/A: F# is functional — Giraffe handlers are `let`-bound HttpHandler values composed with `>=>`, not obj.method() receiver calls, and the fsharp base extractor names `let` entities by their bare name with no class-qualified receiver resolver to consume a receiver_type stamp; route-string linkage is the coverage mechanism (mirrors functional Elixir #4688 / Crystal #4760). Honest exclusions: interpolated/variable paths, subRoute/forward mount-prefix folding, and Giraffe routeCi/routeStartsWith/routex variants are documented follow-ups. |

### Observability

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Log extraction | 🟢 `partial` | `2026-06-13` | 5128 | `internal/custom/fsharp/observability.go`<br>`internal/custom/fsharp/observability_test.go` | #5128 (follow-up #5049): the F# observability extractor (custom_fsharp_observability) recovers log CALL SITES as SCOPE.Pattern/log_extraction entities via a single-file regex heuristic, mirroring the C# observability model (internal/custom/csharp/observability.go). Frameworks: (1) Serilog static API Log.Information/Warning/Error/Debug/Fatal/Verbose(...) and (2) Serilog instance API logger.Information/...(...) -> log_framework=serilog; (3) Microsoft.Extensions.Logging (MEL) logger.LogInformation/LogWarning/LogError/LogDebug/LogTrace/LogCritical(...) -> log_framework=microsoft.extensions.logging; (4) F# console printfn/printf -> level=info and eprintfn/eprintf -> level=error -> log_framework=fsharp.printf. Each entity stamps Properties[log_framework,pattern,log_level] plus the FIRST string-literal arg as message_template (or dynamic=true+traced=true when the message is non-literal/interpolated, no fabricated template). MEL hits are matched first and de-duplicated by source offset so a logger.Log* call is never double-counted as a Serilog instance call, and the Serilog static Log.* never double-emits as an instance call. Proven by TestFSharpObs_SerilogStatic/_SerilogInstance/_MEL/_Printfn/_DynamicTemplate/_WrongLanguageNoop/_NoLoggingNoop. PARTIAL (honest): call-site heuristic only — no cross-file DI binding of ILogger<T> to its concrete handler, no LOGS/emits edge to a sink, and only the first string-literal argument is inspected for the template. Metric/trace extraction remain follow-ups. |

### Data

|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| DB effect | 🟢 `partial` | `2026-06-13` | 5001 | `internal/extractors/cross/dbmap/extractor_test.go`<br>`internal/extractors/cross/dbmap/orms.go`<br>`internal/substrate/effect_sinks_fsharp.go`<br>`internal/substrate/effect_sinks_fsharp_test.go` | #5000 (follow-up #4941): RAW-SQL TABLE ATTRIBUTION + ACCESSES_TABLE for the F# data drivers is now wired through the shared cross-language raw-SQL table extractor (internal/extractors/cross/dbmap). Two import-gated ORM entries were added: `npgsql_fsharp` (import marker `open Npgsql.FSharp`) and `dapper_fsharp` (`open Dapper` / `open Dapper.FSharp`); both delegate to the language-agnostic detectRawSQL scanner (single-/double-/triple-quoted SQL literals -> FROM/INTO/UPDATE/JOIN/TRUNCATE table clauses -> one SCOPE.DataAccess entity + ACCESSES_TABLE edge per table, op classified by leading verb), matching the C#/Crystal precedent (database_sql/jdbc/psycopg2 reuse the same retagRaw path). importTokenRE now recognises the F# `open` keyword so the import gate fires. A dropDuplicateRawScanner(npgsql_fsharp, dapper_fsharp) guard prevents a single F# file matching both drivers from double-emitting the same SQL literal. Proven by TestNpgsqlFSharpRawSQLTables / _TripleQuotedSQL / TestDapperFSharpRawSQLTables / TestNoFSharpDBImportSkipped (Npgsql.FSharp `Sql.query "SELECT ... FROM users"` SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE -> users/orders/accounts/sessions; triple-quoted JOIN -> invoices+customers; Dapper conn.Query<T>/conn.Execute string SQL -> products/stale_jobs; import-gating no-op). DEFERRED (second axis, ticket #5000): EF Core (F#) DbSet table attribution (`ctx.Users` -> `Users` table from the LINQ/`query { for x in ctx.T }` read shape) is NOT a string literal so it does not flow through detectRawSQL; SQLProvider erased `ctx.Dbo.T` table names stay best-effort Sink-tag hints; Dapper ambiguous Execute-without-literal stays unresolved. ===== #4941+#4999 (follow-up #4906): sniffEffectsFSharp is the F# db_effect sniffer (F# had NO db_effect after #4906). Classifies F# data-access primitives into db_read / db_write EffectMatch records attributed to the enclosing `let [rec/inline]` binding or `member this/_/x.Name` (scanFSharpEffectHeaders). Drivers: (1) EF Core (F#) — DbSet LINQ reads ctx.T.Find/Where/Single/First/FirstOrDefault/Any/Count/ToList(Async)/AsNoTracking/Include/FromSqlRaw (fsharpEFReadRe) + the F# `query { for x in ctx.T ... }` CE (fsharpEFQueryCERe) -> db_read; ctx.SaveChanges(Async)/ctx.T.Add(Async)/AddRange/Update/Remove/ExecuteUpdate/ExecuteDelete (fsharpEFWriteRe) -> db_write. (2) Dapper / Dapper.FSharp — conn.Query*/QueryFirst*/QuerySingle*/QueryMultiple*/SelectAsync + `select { for ... }` CE -> db_read; conn.Execute*/ExecuteScalar*/InsertAsync/UpdateAsync/DeleteAsync + `insert`/`update`/`delete` CEs -> db_write. (3) Npgsql.FSharp — Sql.query "<sql>" literal classified by leading SQL verb (SELECT/WITH -> db_read; INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/CREATE/DROP/ALTER/TRUNCATE/MERGE -> db_write), so a SELECT is never misclassified as a write. (4) SQLProvider (#4999) — the type-provider erased data context (ctx.Dbo.TableName) has no stable static call shape, matched syntactically: the `query { for x in ctx.Dbo.T ... }` CE (shared with fsharpEFQueryCERe) + a direct table enumeration ctx.Dbo.T |> Seq.toList/map/filter/... (fsharpSQLProviderReadRe) -> db_read; ctx.SubmitUpdates()/SubmitUpdatesAsync(), the table ``.Create``(...) row factory, and row.Delete() (fsharpSQLProviderWriteRe) -> db_write. Best-effort ctx.Schema.Table (Dbo/Public/Main) attribution is folded into the Sink tag (sqlprovider.read:Users / sqlprovider.write:Users) via fsharpSQLProviderTableRe. Also classifies http_out for System.Net.Http HttpClient.*Async + FsHttp `http { GET ... }`/Http.get. EffectMatch records flow through internal/links/effect_propagation.go like every other language sink. Value-asserted by effect_sinks_fsharp_test.go (EFCore/EFQueryCE/Dapper/Npgsql-verb-discrimination/SQLProvider read+write+table-attribution/SQLProvider-no-false-positive/HTTP/NonDataNoop/Empty/Registered). ===== #5001 (follow-up #4941): the AMBIGUOUS Dapper Execute* family (Execute/ExecuteAsync/ExecuteScalar(Async)/ExecuteReader(Async)) — which runs ARBITRARY SQL and so is read-or-write depending on the statement — is now split out of the unconditional-write path and classified by the LEADING SQL VERB of its string-literal argument (fsharpDapperExecuteRe captures the @?\"...\"/@?\"\"\"...\"\"\" literal, fsharpSQLReadVerbRe tolerates leading whitespace/-- // /* comments): SELECT / WITH (...SELECT) -> db_read (Sink dapper.execute.read, conf 0.9); any other DML/DDL verb -> db_write (Sink dapper.execute.write, conf 0.85); an Execute with NO inspectable literal (SQL bound elsewhere / a stored-proc name) defaults conservatively to db_write (Sink dapper.execute.write?, conf 0.7). ALSO receiver-type resolution: fsharpDapperReceiverTypeRe resolves bindings statically annotated/constructed as an IDbConnection-family type (IDbConnection/DbConnection/SqlConnection/NpgsqlConnection/SqliteConnection/MySqlConnection/OracleConnection/... via `(x: IDbConnection)` param annotation or `let/use x = new SqlConnection(...)`) and folds their NAMES into the Dapper read/write/Execute receiver alternation at sniff time (fsharpResolveDapperReceivers), so differently-named connections (`database`, `pg`, `sqlite`) are classified — the conn/db/cnn name heuristic is now the FALLBACK, not the only gate. Proven by TestSniffEffectsFSharp_DapperExecuteVerb (SELECT count -> read, WITH...SELECT CTE -> read, DELETE -> write, no-literal stored-proc -> write?), _DapperReceiverType (typed `database`/`new SqliteConnection` receivers classified), _DapperReceiverTypeNoLeak (untyped `repository.Query` earns no effect). PARTIAL (honest): regex receiver-name + single-file type resolution (no cross-file/cross-binding flow); Execute classification inspects only the FIRST string literal on the call (a SQL value assembled across lets / interpolated / parameterised-elsewhere falls to the conservative write default); receiver-type resolution covers param annotations + `new`-constructor bindings, not factory-returned or DI-injected connections; SQLProvider provided types are erased so table names are best-effort hints, not resolved entities; SQLProvider writes via an intermediate `let row = ctx.Dbo.T.Create()` binding attribute to `row` (inner-let header shadowing) rather than the enclosing function; ACCESSES_TABLE wiring + raw-SQL table extraction remain documented follow-ups; cross-file/DI receiver-type resolution + interpolated/assembled-SQL verb inference deferred to follow-ups. |
