Root type Query/Mutation/Subscription + root fields parsed from the inline gql document (shared gqlRootFieldsFromDoc with the JS/TS pass). Identical entity shape to the GraphQL server producer so the cross-repo linker pairs the Flutter screen with the backend resolver on reindex. Value-asserted: gql(r'''query GetUser { user { id name } }''') -> http:GRAPHQL:/graphql/Query/user; inline mutation createUser; multi-field query; subscription messageAdded; negatives (REST dio.get, plain string) emit nothing. |
