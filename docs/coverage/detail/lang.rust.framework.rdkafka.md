## Capabilities

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Consumer extraction | 🟢 `partial` | `2026-05-31` | 3558 | `internal/engine/kafka_edges.go`<br>`internal/engine/kafka_edges_test.go` | rdkafka FutureRecord::to("topic")/BaseRecord::to("topic") -> PUBLISHES_TO and StreamConsumer .subscribe(&["a","b"]) -> SUBSCRIBES_TO, attributed to the enclosing fn (SCOPE.Operation); MessageTopic keyed kafka:<topic> joins cross-repo. Partial: only literal topic names are resolved (const/variable topics fall back to dynamic kafka:channel), and caller attribution is same-file nearest-fn. |
