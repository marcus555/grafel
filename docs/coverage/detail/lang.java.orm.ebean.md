## Capabilities


### Models

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Model extraction | ✅ `full` | `2026-05-29` | — | `internal/custom/java/ebean.go`<br>`internal/custom/java/orm_extractors_test.go` | No Ebean extractor; Ebean uses non-JPA @Entity from io.ebean package. |
| Schema extraction | 🟢 `partial` | `2026-05-29` | [link](https://github.com/cajasmota/archigraph/issues/3097) | `internal/custom/java/ebean.go`<br>`internal/custom/java/jpa_fk_lazy.go`<br>`internal/custom/java/jpa_fk_lazy_test.go` | Captures @Table table_name + Model base-class marker + @Column(name/nullable/length) attribute depth; full DDL introspection not parsed. |

### Relationships

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Association extraction | ✅ `full` | `2026-05-29` | — | `internal/custom/java/ebean.go`<br>`internal/custom/java/orm_extractors_test.go` | No Ebean extractor exists. Ebean has its own annotation style (@Entity from io.ebean). A dedicated extractor would be needed; tracked in issue #3001. |
| Foreign key extraction | 🟢 `partial` | `2026-05-29` | [link](https://github.com/cajasmota/archigraph/issues/3097) | `internal/custom/java/ebean.go`<br>`internal/custom/java/jpa_fk_lazy.go`<br>`internal/custom/java/jpa_fk_lazy_test.go` | @JoinColumn(name=) and @ForeignKey(name=) parsed; emits SCOPE.Component/foreign_key entities |
| Lazy loading recognition | 🟢 `partial` | `2026-05-29` | [link](https://github.com/cajasmota/archigraph/issues/3097) | `internal/custom/java/ebean.go`<br>`internal/custom/java/jpa_fk_lazy.go`<br>`internal/custom/java/jpa_fk_lazy_test.go` | FetchType.LAZY and FetchType.EAGER parsed from association annotations; emits SCOPE.Component/fetch_config entities |
| Relationship extraction | ✅ `full` | `2026-05-29` | — | `internal/custom/java/ebean.go`<br>`internal/custom/java/orm_extractors_test.go` | No Ebean extractor exists. Ebean has its own annotation style (@Entity from io.ebean). A dedicated extractor would be needed; tracked in issue #3001. |

### Migrations

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Migration parsing | — `not_applicable` | `2026-05-29` | — | — | ORM model-definition layer; database migration files are owned by Flyway/Liquibase, not the ORM itself. Same rationale as lang.java.orm.jooq and lang.java.orm.neo4j N/A. |
| Migration schema ops | 🔴 `missing` | — | 3628 | — | — |

### Transactions

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Transaction function stamping | 🔴 `missing` | — | 3628-transaction-function-stamping | — | — |
