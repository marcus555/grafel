## Capabilities

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Consumer extraction | 🔴 `missing` | — | 3682 | — | Client-side Phoenix channel.join() extraction not yet implemented; producer-side endpoints land in #3682. |
| Producer extraction | ✅ `full` | `2026-06-02` | — | `internal/engine/realtime_endpoint_synthesis.go`<br>`internal/engine/realtime_endpoint_synthesis_test.go` | #3682 (epic #3628 area #7): Phoenix 'channel "topic:*", XChannel' declarations in a Phoenix.Socket module emit endpoint-shaped http_endpoint_definition entities http:WS:<topic> (transport=channels) with a HANDLES edge Class:XChannel -> endpoint. Honest-partial: topic wildcards (room:*) are kept verbatim as the route_path; per-message handle_in event extraction is deferred. |
| Room channel grouping | ✅ `full` | `2026-06-02` | 3628 | `internal/engine/ws_channel_grouping.go`<br>`internal/engine/ws_channel_grouping_test.go` | [realtime] Phoenix channel-topic grouping (#3628 child): applyWSChannelGrouping (elixir) emits BROADCASTS_TO(fn -> SCOPE.Channel:<topic>) for MyApp.Endpoint.broadcast("room:1", ...) / broadcast_from with a LITERAL topic (e.g. room:42); enclosing def/defp attributes the caller. Honest-partial: broadcast(socket, ...) on an implicit dynamic socket topic and interpolated topics are skipped. |
| Topic attribution | 🟢 `partial` | `2026-06-02` | — | `internal/engine/realtime_endpoint_synthesis.go` | Topic pattern captured verbatim as route_path (room:*); wildcard segments not expanded. |
