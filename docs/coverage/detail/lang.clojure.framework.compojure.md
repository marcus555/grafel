Proven by TestClojure_CompojureRoutes. Handler attribution is partial — trailing handler symbol not yet bound to its defn entity (route emitted with empty handler ref, resolver binds by same-name when present). |
| Handler attribution | 🟢 `partial` | — | 4749 | `internal/engine/http_endpoint_clojure.go`<br>`internal/engine/http_endpoint_clojure_test.go`<br>`internal/engine/httproutes/canonicalize.go` | Route emitted with empty handler ref; resolver binds by same-name handler when present. Trailing-form handler symbol not yet bound to its defn entity — honest partial. |

| Websocket route extraction | 🔴 `missing` | `2026-06-14` | — | — | #4965: dedicated websocket_route_extraction not yet implemented for this framework. The capability key was introduced for the rust axum/actix/warp WS extractor (internal/custom/rust/websocket_routes.go); this framework's WebSocket-upgrade idiom is not yet recognised and is a follow-up gap. |

### Testing

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Tests linkage | ✅ `full` | `2026-06-11` | — | `internal/custom/clojure/tests_route_e2e.go`<br>`internal/engine/http_endpoint_clojure.go`<br>`internal/engine/http_endpoint_e2e_testmap.go`<br>`internal/engine/http_endpoint_e2e_testmap_4749_clojure_test.go` | Test->endpoint route-hit linkage (#4749, slice of all-framework #4615). Clojure is FUNCTIONAL (no OO receiver objects) so local-variable/receiver typing (#4680/#4681) is N/A — a Ring handler is dispatched by the literal route string on the mock request map, not by an obj.method() receiver; route-string linkage is the coverage mechanism (mirrors functional Elixir #4688). custom_clojure_tests_route_e2e (internal/custom/clojure/tests_route_e2e.go) emits one test_suite per clojure.test file (*_test.clj/cljc/cljs or /test/ dir) carrying e2e_route_calls (VERB+route) for ring-mock (app (mock/request :get "/path")) and peridot/kerodon (request app "/path" :request-method :get) route hits; the language-agnostic engine.linkE2ERouteTestsToEndpoints pass (#4351/#4369) matches each pair to the http_endpoint_definition synthesised by synthesizeClojureRoutes and emits the TESTS edge. Proven RED->GREEN in http_endpoint_e2e_testmap_4749_clojure_test.go (GET+POST + path-param). Test scope: (deftest name ...) are named fns already mined; route hits live inside the deftest body so the suite is keyed per-file (one suite/file, like Jest/ExUnit) — no synthetic anonymous-block scope-owner needed. Honest exclusion: interpolated/built routes ((mock/request :get (str "/x/" id))) and variable routes are dropped (non-literal). |
