## Capabilities


### Models

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Model extraction | — `not_applicable` | — | — | — | — |
| Model lifecycle extraction | 🔴 `missing` | — | 3628 | — | — |
| Schema extraction | 🟢 `partial` | `2026-06-02` | 3609 | `internal/custom/python/neo4j_neomodel.go`<br>`internal/custom/python/neo4j_neomodel_test.go` | neomodel OGM (not just the raw driver): each StructuredNode subclass is extracted as a SCOPE.Schema/node (the graph node label) and each *Property() attribute as a SCOPE.Schema/property. Regex over class bodies; partial (no inheritance/mixin StructuredNode resolution). |

### Relationships

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Association extraction | 🟢 `partial` | — | 3609 | `internal/custom/python/neo4j_neomodel.go` | neomodel RelationshipTo/RelationshipFrom attributes are extracted as SCOPE.Component/relationship entities carrying relation_type, direction, and target_node. |
| Foreign key extraction | — `not_applicable` | — | — | — | graph DB — no foreign-key concept |
| Lazy loading recognition | — `not_applicable` | — | — | — | graph DB — no lazy-loading concept |
| Relationship extraction | ✅ `full` | `2026-06-02` | 3609 | `internal/custom/python/neo4j_neomodel.go`<br>`internal/custom/python/neo4j_neomodel_test.go` | neomodel RelationshipTo/RelationshipFrom('Target','REL_TYPE') fields are extracted AND emitted as traversable GRAPH_RELATES graph-schema edges owner-node -> target-node (mirrors the Java SDN template #3663 / JOINS_COLLECTION for graph DBs); the domain graph topology is a navigable subgraph rather than opaque string props. Full for same-file StructuredNode targets (value-asserting test TestNeomodelGraphRelatesEdge: Person -GRAPH_RELATES(ACTED_IN,OUTGOING)-> Movie; RelationshipFrom -> INCOMING). Cross-file target labels are honest-partial (kept as target_node props only). Reverses the #3635 datastore-pass downgrade for this OGM. |

### Queries

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Query attribution | 🟢 `partial` | `2026-06-05` | [link](https://github.com/cajasmota/archigraph/issues/3645) | `internal/engine/orm_queries.go`<br>`internal/engine/orm_queries_datastore_infra.go`<br>`internal/engine/orm_queries_datastore_infra_test.go` | Driver topology: the neo4j-python `session.run("MATCH (n:Label) ...")` Cypher string (cypherRunRe, import-gated on mentionsNeo4jDriver) is captured via scanInfra->emitCypherTargets; the FIRST node label + CRUD verb (create/merge/set/delete) parsed into a QUERIES edge to Class:<Label>. Partial: only the first label of a multi-label pattern is attributed and dynamic/parameterised labels are honest-skipped (#3645). |

### Migrations

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
