## Capabilities


### Models

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Model extraction | 🟢 `partial` | `2026-05-28` | — | `internal/engine/rules/scala/orms/quill.yaml` | — |
| Model lifecycle extraction | 🔴 `missing` | — | 3628 | — | — |
| Schema extraction | ✅ `full` | — | — | `internal/custom/scala/orm_extractors.go` | quillQuerySchemaRe captures querySchema[T]("table") mappings; quillCaseClassRe captures entity case classes; compile-time macro expansion limits runtime introspection |

### Relationships

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Association extraction | ✅ `full` | — | — | `internal/custom/scala/orm_extractors.go` | quillQuoteQueryRe captures quote {} blocks containing query[T] references; JOIN associations expressed in quoted DSL blocks |
| Foreign key extraction | — `not_applicable` | — | — | `internal/custom/scala/orm_extractors.go` | Quill has no FK declaration DSL; FK constraints live in the DB schema, not in Quill entity definitions |
| Lazy loading recognition | — `not_applicable` | — | — | `internal/custom/scala/orm_extractors.go` | Quill generates compile-time queries; all queries are explicit and eager — no transparent lazy-loading mechanism |
| Relationship extraction | 🟢 `partial` | — | backfill:dictionary-completeness | `internal/custom/scala/orm_extractors.go` | quote{} join(query[T]) blocks captured as join associations with joined_entity; resolving the on-predicate column pairing across the quote body is out of scope — honest partial |

### Queries

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Query attribution | 🟢 `partial` | `2026-05-28` | — | `internal/engine/rules/scala/orms/quill.yaml` | — |

### Migrations

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Migration parsing | — `not_applicable` | — | — | `internal/custom/scala/orm_extractors.go` | Quill does not manage schema migrations; use Flyway/Liquibase/scala-migrations alongside Quill |
| Migration schema ops | 🔴 `missing` | — | 3628 | — | — |

### Transactions

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Transaction function stamping | 🔴 `missing` | — | 3628-transaction-function-stamping | — | — |
