## Capabilities


### Models

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Model extraction | — `not_applicable` | — | — | — | — |
| Schema extraction | 🟢 `partial` | `2026-06-02` | 3610 | `internal/custom/javascript/neogma.go`<br>`internal/custom/javascript/neogma_test.go` | neogma OGM (not just the raw driver): each ModelFactory({ label, schema, relationships }) call is extracted as a SCOPE.Schema/node keyed on its Neo4j `label`. Regex over the balanced config object; partial (schema field types not individually emitted). |

### Relationships

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Association extraction | 🟢 `partial` | — | 3610 | `internal/custom/javascript/neogma.go` | neogma relationships.<key> entries are extracted as SCOPE.Component/relationship entities carrying relation_type, direction, and target_model/target_node. |
| Foreign key extraction | — `not_applicable` | — | — | — | graph DB — no foreign-key concept |
| Lazy loading recognition | — `not_applicable` | — | — | — | graph DB — no lazy-loading concept |
| Relationship extraction | ✅ `full` | `2026-06-02` | 3610 | `internal/custom/javascript/neogma.go`<br>`internal/custom/javascript/neogma_test.go` | neogma ModelFactory relationships ({ model: Target, name: 'REL_TYPE', direction: 'out'|'in' }) are extracted AND emitted as traversable GRAPH_RELATES graph-schema edges owner-node -> target-node (mirrors the Java SDN template #3663 / JOINS_COLLECTION for graph DBs); the domain graph topology is a navigable subgraph rather than opaque string props. Full for same-file ModelFactory `model:` bindings (value-asserting test TestNeogmaGraphRelatesEdge: Person -GRAPH_RELATES(ACTED_IN,OUTGOING)-> Movie; direction 'in' -> INCOMING). Cross-file model references are honest-partial (kept as target_model props only). Reverses the #3635 datastore-pass downgrade for this OGM. |

### Queries

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Query attribution | ✅ `full` | `2026-05-28` | — | `internal/engine/orm_queries_jsts_drivers.go`<br>`internal/engine/orm_queries_jsts_drivers_test.go` | Includes Cypher node-label attribution: session.run('MATCH (n:Label) ...') resolves the graph node label as the queried resource and maps MATCH/CREATE/MERGE/SET/DELETE clauses to canonical operations. |
