## Capabilities


### Models

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Model extraction | — `not_applicable` | — | — | — | — |
| Schema extraction | 🟢 `partial` | `2026-05-30` | 3189 | `internal/custom/python/driver_schema.go` | Heuristic: parses CREATE TABLE DDL embedded in raw-driver cursor.execute(...) string literals into SCOPE.Schema table + column entities. Single-literal SQL only; string-concatenated DDL not stitched. |

### Relationships

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Association extraction | — `not_applicable` | — | — | — | raw driver — no ORM relationship model |
| Foreign key extraction | — `not_applicable` | — | — | — | raw driver — no ORM relationship model |
| Lazy loading recognition | — `not_applicable` | — | — | — | raw driver — no ORM relationship model |

### Queries

| Query attribution | ✅ `full` | `2026-06-02` | — | `internal/engine/rules/python/orms/mysql_py.yaml`<br>`internal/extractors/cross/dbmap/orms.go`<br>`internal/extractors/python/raw_sql_db_calls.go` | Raw cursor.execute("…") SQL now resolves table topology: dbmap.detectPyDBAPI (import-gated on pymysql/mysqlclient) parses FROM/INTO/UPDATE/JOIN and emits SCOPE.DataAccess + ACCESSES_TABLE edges with read/write verb. Value-asserting test TestPyDBAPIPymysqlInsertWritesOrders. Dynamic/concatenated SQL → no fabricated table (#3644). |
