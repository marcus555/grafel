## Capabilities


### Schema

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Federation extraction | — `not_applicable` | — | 3623 | — | Apollo GraphQL Federation directives (@key/@external/@requires/@provides/extend type) do not exist in this RPC framework; not applicable. |
| Procedure extraction | 🟢 `partial` | `2026-05-30` | backfill:dictionary-completeness | `internal/custom/cpp/grpc.go`<br>`internal/custom/cpp/grpc_protobuf_test.go` | each overridden Status RPC method -> SCOPE.Operation endpoint |
| Schema extraction | 🟢 `partial` | `2026-05-30` | backfill:dictionary-completeness | `internal/custom/cpp/grpc.go`<br>`internal/custom/cpp/grpc_protobuf_test.go` | req/resp messages emitted as SCOPE.Schema DTO refs (names only) |
| Type graph extraction | — `not_applicable` | — | 3804 | — | GraphQL schema type→type graph (object-typed field -> referenced object type with list/nullable cardinality) is a GraphQL-SDL concept; gRPC/protobuf/tRPC message schemas are modelled separately and have no GraphQL object-type relationship graph. |

### Codegen

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Client codegen | 🟢 `partial` | `2026-05-30` | backfill:dictionary-completeness | `internal/custom/cpp/grpc.go`<br>`internal/custom/cpp/grpc_protobuf_test.go` | Service::NewStub(channel) client-stub site detected |

### Transport

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Transport binding | 🟢 `partial` | `2026-05-30` | backfill:dictionary-completeness | `internal/custom/cpp/grpc.go`<br>`internal/custom/cpp/grpc_protobuf_test.go` | RPC endpoint synthesis from service-impl override methods + RegisterService; regex, no AST |

### Routing

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Endpoint deprecation versioning | — `not_applicable` | — | — | — | HTTP endpoint deprecation/versioning (Sunset/Deprecation headers, /v1 route segments) is an HTTP-API concept; gRPC versions via proto package + service evolution, not HTTP route versioning. |
| Endpoint pagination posture | — `not_applicable` | — | — | — | HTTP limit/offset/page/cursor pagination posture is an HTTP-endpoint concept; gRPC paginates via in-message fields / server-streaming, not HTTP query params. |
| Endpoint response codes | — `not_applicable` | — | — | — | HTTP status-code sets do not apply to gRPC, which signals outcome via grpc::StatusCode on the trailer, not HTTP 2xx/4xx codes. |
| Endpoint synthesis | — `not_applicable` | — | — | — | HTTP http_endpoint synthesis (path+verb producer endpoints) does not apply to gRPC; service registration is captured as transport_binding. gRPC method addressing is package.Service/Method, not an HTTP path+verb. |
| Handler attribution | — `not_applicable` | — | — | — | No HTTP handler->route attribution for gRPC. RPC-method->service binding is modelled by procedure_extraction (rpc/service) + the service-impl in schema_extraction, not by an HTTP route table. |
| Route extraction | — `not_applicable` | — | — | — | gRPC has no HTTP route paths; the HTTP route extractor emits 0 entities on a gRPC service impl. RPC method addressing is package.Service/Method, surfaced via procedure_extraction + transport_binding. |

### View

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| View rendering | — `not_applicable` | — | — | — | gRPC services render no server-side views/templates; responses are protobuf messages (tRPC returns plain typed values), not rendered views. |

### Auth

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Auth coverage | ✅ `full` | `2026-06-03` | 4041 | `internal/custom/cpp/grpc.go`<br>`internal/custom/cpp/grpc_auth_test.go` | gRPC-C++ interceptor / AuthMetadataProcessor auth detection (#4041). resolveCppGrpcAuth re-scans the gRPC service file and, when an auth enforcer is PRESENT and WIRED, stamps auth_required/auth_method=grpc_interceptor/auth_middleware/auth_confidence on each RPC-method SCOPE.Operation endpoint. Enforcers: (a) a class deriving grpc::experimental::Interceptor whose Intercept() reads incoming client metadata AND fails with grpc::StatusCode::UNAUTHENTICATED/PERMISSION_DENIED, wired via builder.experimental().SetInterceptorCreators(...); (b) a grpc::AuthMetadataProcessor whose Process() returns UNAUTHENTICATED/PERMISSION_DENIED, wired via creds->SetAuthMetadataProcessor(...). auth_middleware carries the concrete enforcer class (the archigraph_auth_coverage signal-1 key). VALUE-ASSERTED: a JwtAuth interceptor + SetInterceptorCreators -> SayHello/SayBye auth_required=true, auth_middleware=JwtAuth; a TokenProcessor -> GetFeature auth_middleware=TokenProcessor. NEGATIVES proven: a logging interceptor (no UNAUTHENTICATED reject), a no-interceptor server, and a present-but-unwired interceptor all leave methods UNSTAMPED. HONEST same-file boundary: enforcer class + wiring + RegisterService must co-locate (matches the rest of the gRPC-C++ synthesis). DEPLOY-DEFERRED. |

### Validation

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| DTO extraction | — `not_applicable` | — | — | — | gRPC request/response payloads are protobuf messages (tRPC: zod-typed inputs), surfaced under schema_extraction; MVC DTO inference does not model them. HTTP MVC DTO extractor yields 0 entities on a gRPC service. |
| Request validation | — `not_applicable` | — | — | — | gRPC has no MVC request-validation pipeline; message-field constraints live in proto (tRPC validates via the zod input schema, surfaced as schema, not an MVC validator). HTTP MVC validation extractor yields 0 entities here. |

### Middleware

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Middleware coverage | — `not_applicable` | — | — | — | gRPC cross-cutting concerns use interceptors (tRPC: middleware links), not the HTTP framework's Use*/plug/filter request-pipeline. The HTTP middleware extractor yields 0 entities on a gRPC service; interceptor cataloguing is potential future work. |
| Rate limit stamping | — `not_applicable` | — | — | — | HTTP endpoint rate-limit/throttle stamping is an HTTP-middleware concept; gRPC throttling is done via interceptors/server options, not HTTP rate limiters. |

### Type System

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Enum extraction | ✅ `full` | `2026-06-03` | — | `internal/extractors/cpp/extractor.go` | language-level type-system sniffer is framework-agnostic; fires on enums in gRPC service/contract code. VERIFIED on the gRPC idiom. |
| Interface extraction | ✅ `full` | `2026-06-03` | — | `internal/extractors/cpp/extractor.go` | framework-agnostic; fires on the gRPC service impl/contract interface. VERIFIED on the gRPC idiom. |
| Type alias extraction | ✅ `full` | `2026-06-03` | — | `internal/extractors/cpp/extractor.go` | framework-agnostic; fires on type aliases in gRPC code. VERIFIED on the gRPC idiom. |
| Type extraction | ✅ `full` | `2026-06-03` | — | `internal/extractors/cpp/extractor.go` | framework-agnostic; fires on every gRPC service-impl class / payload struct / case class. VERIFIED on the gRPC idiom. |

### DI

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |

### Testing

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Tests linkage | ✅ `full` | `2026-06-03` | — | `internal/extractors/cross/testmap/frameworks_cpp.go`<br>`internal/extractors/cross/testmap/resolver.go` | test-framework sniffer keys on the standard test macros, not the framework-under-test; links gRPC service/router tests like any other test. VERIFIED a named test case is extracted from a gRPC test idiom. |

### Observability

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Log extraction | 🟢 `partial` | — | — | `internal/custom/cpp/observability.go`<br>`internal/substrate/template_pattern_c_cpp.go` | logging sniffer is library/call-keyed (framework-agnostic); fires on a gRPC service that logs. VERIFIED on the gRPC idiom. PARTIAL: heuristic. |
| Metric extraction | ✅ `full` | — | — | `internal/custom/cpp/observability.go`<br>`internal/substrate/template_pattern_c_cpp.go` | metric sniffer is library-keyed (framework-agnostic); fires for gRPC services that instrument metrics. VERIFIED on the gRPC idiom. |
| Trace extraction | ✅ `full` | — | — | `internal/custom/cpp/observability.go`<br>`internal/substrate/template_pattern_c_cpp.go` | trace sniffer is library-keyed (framework-agnostic); fires for gRPC services that instrument traces. |
