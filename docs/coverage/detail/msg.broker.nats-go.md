| Consumer extraction | ✅ `full` | `2026-06-12` | — | `internal/engine/nats_edges.go`<br>`internal/engine/nats_edges_test.go` | #4923: synthesizeGoNATS resolves nc.Subscribe/QueueSubscribe consumer sites -> SUBSCRIBES_TO topic:nats:<subject>. Honest limit: string-literal subjects (wildcards/dynamic subjects not normalised). |
| Producer extraction | ✅ `full` | `2026-06-14` | — | `internal/engine/nats_edges.go`<br>`internal/engine/nats_edges_test.go` | #4923 (de-dupe of multi msg.broker.nats — Go topology was invisible to a Go auditor): synthesizeGoNATS (nats_edges.go, case "go") resolves nc.Publish(subject,...)/JetStream js.Publish producer sites (messaging_layer=nats.go) -> PUBLISHES_TO topic:nats:<subject> from the enclosing func. |
| Topic attribution | ✅ `full` | `2026-06-12` | — | `internal/engine/nats_edges.go`<br>`internal/links/topic_pass.go` | #4923: literal NATS subjects become topic:nats:<subject> nodes joined producer->consumer cross-repo via topic_pass.go (channel=nats). |
