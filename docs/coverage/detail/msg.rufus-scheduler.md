| Consumer extraction | 🟢 `partial` | — | 3628 | `internal/engine/scheduled_jobs_edges.go`<br>`internal/engine/scheduled_jobs_edges_test.go` | #3628 area: scheduler.cron/every/interval/in/at 'EXPR' do ... end emits a SCOPE.ScheduledJob (rufus:<path>:<expr>) carrying '<kind> <expr>' as schedule and a TRIGGERS edge to the first bare method call in the block body. Honest-partial: block-body handler is a heuristic first-call proxy; multi-statement blocks pick the first call. |
