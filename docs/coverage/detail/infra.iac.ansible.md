## Capabilities

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Dependency attribution | 🟢 `partial` | `2026-05-28` | — | `internal/extractors/yaml/extractor.go` | — |
| Iac cross stack reference | — `not_applicable` | — | — | — | Ansible has no cross-stack / remote-state construct and the yaml extractor emits no cross-stack reference. Honest-missing. |
| Iac iam grant attribution | — `not_applicable` | — | — | — | Ansible playbooks model IAM via task modules (e.g. iam_policy), not a grant-call idiom; the yaml extractor emits generic task/resource entities with no grantee→target grant edge or grant-method attribution. Honest-missing. |
| Iac output export extraction | — `not_applicable` | — | — | — | Ansible playbooks have no stack-output/export construct (register / set_fact are runtime task vars, not published stack outputs); the yaml extractor emits no output/export entity. Honest-missing. |
| Resource extraction | 🟢 `partial` | `2026-05-28` | — | `internal/extractors/yaml/extractor.go` | — |
