## Capabilities

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Dependency attribution | 🟢 `partial` | `2026-05-28` | — | `internal/extractors/yaml/extractor.go` | — |
| Iac cross stack reference | — `not_applicable` | — | — | — | Ansible has no cross-stack / remote-state construct and the yaml extractor emits no cross-stack reference. Honest-missing. |
| Iac environment region account | — `not_applicable` | — | — | — | Ansible playbooks pass region/account targeting as ad-hoc task-module args (e.g. aws_region:, region:) or environment/inventory vars, not a uniform stack-level deployment target; the yaml extractor emits generic task/resource entities and stamps no region/account/provider/runtime environment-targeting property. Honest-missing. |
| Iac event source wiring | — `not_applicable` | — | — | — | Ansible playbooks model event-driven invocation via task modules, not a function-event-source binding; the yaml extractor emits generic task/resource entities with no event-source→function trigger edge or trigger-type attribution. Honest-missing. |
| Iac iam grant attribution | — `not_applicable` | — | — | — | Ansible playbooks model IAM via task modules (e.g. iam_policy), not a grant-call idiom; the yaml extractor emits generic task/resource entities with no grantee→target grant edge or grant-method attribution. Honest-missing. |
| Iac output export extraction | — `not_applicable` | — | — | — | Ansible playbooks have no stack-output/export construct (register / set_fact are runtime task vars, not published stack outputs); the yaml extractor emits no output/export entity. Honest-missing. |
| Iac resource property extraction | — `not_applicable` | — | — | — | Ansible playbooks emit generic task/play entities with no typed resource property bag (tasks are runtime module invocations, not declared resources with a stampable settings map). Honest-missing. |
| Iac stack app topology | — `not_applicable` | — | — | — | Ansible composition is role/include based (roles/, include_tasks, import_playbook), but the ansible yaml rules emit generic task/play entities with no stack/app/module composition entity and no role→task or playbook→role containment relationship modelling the structural topology. Honest-missing. |
| Resource extraction | 🟢 `partial` | `2026-05-28` | — | `internal/extractors/yaml/extractor.go` | — |
