## Capabilities

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Config binding | 🔴 `missing` | — | 5782 | — | — |
| Consumer extraction | 🟢 `partial` | `2026-06-14` | 5125 | `internal/engine/rabbitmq_edges.go`<br>`internal/engine/rabbitmq_edges_test.go` | #4996: synthesizeCSharpRabbitMQ (rabbitmq_edges.go, case "csharp") resolves RabbitMQ.Client channel.BasicConsume(queue: "q" | positional) consumer sites -> SUBSCRIBES_TO rabbitmq:<name> (messaging_layer=rabbitmq-dotnet), and records channel.QueueDeclare(...) queue nodes. #5125: the EventingBasicConsumer.Received += <Handler>; method-group form now attributes an additional SUBSCRIBES_TO from the NAMED handler method to the single consumed queue (handler=method_group), so the actual message processor is in-graph rather than only the BasicConsume wiring method; the inline-lambda form needs no extra edge (its body lives in the enclosing method BasicConsume already attributes). Honest-partial: literal queue names only; handler attribution requires a single unambiguous BasicConsume queue in the file. |
| Producer extraction | 🟢 `partial` | `2026-06-13` | 4996 | `internal/engine/rabbitmq_edges.go`<br>`internal/engine/rabbitmq_edges_test.go` | #4996: synthesizeCSharpRabbitMQ resolves channel.BasicPublish(exchange:, routingKey:, ...) (named, either order) and the positional BasicPublish("ex", "rk", ...) producer sites -> PUBLISHES_TO from the enclosing method, keyed by the routing-key literal (rabbitmq:<name>), with the exchange recorded as an edge property. Honest-partial: literal routing-key only; fanout (empty routing key) and dynamic keys not attributed. |
| Topic attribution | 🟢 `partial` | `2026-06-14` | 5125 | `internal/engine/rabbitmq_edges.go`<br>`internal/links/topic_pass.go` | #4996: routing-key/queue literals become rabbitmq:<name> SCOPE.Queue nodes joined producer->consumer cross-repo via topic_pass.go (channel=rabbitmq); exchange recorded as edge prop. #5125: exchange-binding topology is now decomposed -- channel.ExchangeDeclare(exchange, type) (named/positional, "fanout"/"direct"/"topic"/ExchangeType.X) emits a SCOPE.Queue exchange node (id rabbitmq:exchange:<name>, entity_role=exchange, exchange_type=<type>), and channel.QueueBind(queue, exchange, routingKey) emits a ROUTES_TO edge exchange-node->queue-node carrying routing_key. Honest-partial: literal queue/exchange/routing-key names only. |
