## Framework-specific

### Objection Relation Graph

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Relation graph extraction | ✅ `full` | `2026-05-28` | — | `internal/custom/javascript/extractors_coverage_test.go`<br>`internal/custom/javascript/objection.go` | Objection's bespoke `static relationMappings` declaration (BelongsToOneRelation / HasManyRelation / ManyToManyRelation / HasOneThroughRelation) drives its eager-load + nested-mutation graph API (withGraphFetched / upsertGraph). No standard ORM cell (model_extraction / query_attribution / migration_parsing) captures this relation-graph topology, so it is recorded as a framework-specific capability. Each relation entry is emitted as a SCOPE.Component relation entity tagged with its relation_type. |
