## Capabilities

| Capability | Status | Verified at | Issue | Cites | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Resource extraction | 🟢 `partial` | `2026-05-31` | [link](https://github.com/cajasmota/archigraph/issues/3528) | `internal/engine/pulumi_edges.go`<br>`internal/engine/rules/javascript_typescript/frameworks/pulumi.yaml`<br>`internal/engine/rules/python/frameworks/pulumi.yaml` | Pulumi-TS + Pulumi-Python only: applyPulumiEdges emits SCOPE.InfraResource per resource constructor named by its logical-name string literal (construct_type + uniform resource_category from the shared types.IaCResourceCategory classifier, #3549; resource_scope kept as an alias). Pulumi-Go/C#/Java not yet implemented. Previously over-stamped full citing the hcl/Terraform extractor, which cannot parse .ts/.py. |
