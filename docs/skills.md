# Skills

grafel ships a family of Claude Code slash-command skills. Each skill owns one concern and is idempotent — safe to re-run after any graph change.

The canonical reference is:

**[`skills/README.md`](../skills/README.md)**

This page is a pointer and summary. Do not duplicate the skills/README.md content here.

## Install

Skills are installed automatically by `grafel install`. To refresh after an upgrade:

```sh
grafel install --skills    # refresh skills only
grafel doctor              # check which skills are installed and up-to-date
```

Skills land in `~/.claude/skills/` where Claude Code discovers them.
